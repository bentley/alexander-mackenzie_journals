<h2>Introduction.</h2>

<p>The exact date of Sir Alexander Mackenzie's birth is not accurately
known, although it is supposed he was born at Inverness, Scotland, about
1755.  He came to North America at an early age and obtained employment
in the counting-house of Messrs. Gregory and Co., a connexion of the
North-West Fur Company.  It was while he was with this company that he
obtained the experience and knowledge necessary to his profession of a
fur-trader, long before he undertook his arduous and dangerous
expeditions to the far North.  He was soon to distinguish himself.  His
firm gave him a small venture to Detroit on condition that he penetrate
to the back country, which was then almost entirely unexplored, and open
up trade with the Indians.  He carried out his task in his usual
thorough manner, but not without a severe struggle with a party of
European traders, who had already obtained a foothold on the margin of
this district, and who resented any interference with their monopoly by
outside parties.  However, finally the intruders were permitted to
remain and share in the trade with the first comers.  For many years
after  this, Mr.
Mackenzie was occupied in trading and exploring in
various parts of the continent, but of these operations we have,
unfortunately, little or no record.  After the amalgamation of the
North-West Company with the older Hudson's-Bay Company, Mr. Mackenzie
appears to have resided in Canada, where he became a member of the
provincial parliament, representing Huntingdon County.  He married in
1812, and afterwards bought an estate at Avoch, Ross-shire, Scotland,
where he resided until his death in March, 1820.</p>

<p>It is as an explorer of the vast and lonely wilds of the North that
Mackenzie's fame chiefly rests.  The bravery and hardihood which carried
him thousands of miles over the prairie and muskegs of the illimitable
plains, down the rapids of great unknown rivers, over the ranges of
almost impassable mountains, will always command the admiration of all
who care for noble deeds. With a small party of Canadian
<i>voyageurs</i> and Indians, in birch-bark canoes, Mr. Mackenzie
started to explore the unknown regions of the North.  Skirting the Great
Slave Lake, he finally entered the Mackenzie River, and then began that
long, deep plunge into the wilderness, which lasted many months, until
he finally emerged on the shores of the Arctic Ocean, in
Latitude  69. North.
Here he set up a post with his name and date of visit.  The return
voyage was fraught with many dangers and vicissitudes, but he finally
arrived safely at Fort Chippewayan in September, 1789.</p>

<p>Mr. Mackenzie's next expedition was even more dangerous and difficult
than the former.  He started from Fort Chippewayan on the 10th of July,
1792, with the object of reaching the Pacific Coast, an enterprise never
before attempted by a European.  After more than nine months of perilous
travel he achieved his ambition and reached the Great Western Ocean near
Cape Menzies on the 22nd June, 1793.  He is said to have inscribed on
the face of a rock the date of his visit, and here it was that he was
nearly murdered by the natives before setting out on his return.</p>

<p>The results of Mr. Mackenzie's voyages to the far North have not been
meagre.  The opening of the territory to the west of the Rocky
Mountains, followed quickly after; and the great Hudson's-Bay Company
immediately started to stud the whole northern country with small
trading posts, whence have been drawn since incalculable riches in the
furs of the North.</p>

<p>All this is easy enough to write down, but the tale is still far from
being told in full.  What of the long days of gloom and
 loneliness, days of
peril and uncertainty, days when hope had almost reached the vanishing
point?  Who shall speak? It is a fascinating record which has placed the
name of this indomitable Scotchman beside the names of the world's
greatest explorers.</p>

<h2>Preface.</h2>

<p>On presenting this Volume to my Country, it is not necessary to enter
into a particular account of those voyages whose journals form the
principal part of it, as they will be found, I trust, to explain
themselves.  It appears, however, to be a duty, which the Public have a
right to expect from me, to state the reasons which have influenced me
in delaying the publication of them.</p>

<p>It has been asserted, that a misunderstanding between a person high in
office and myself, was the cause of this procrastination.  It has also
been propagated, that it was occasioned by that precaution which the
policy of commerce will sometimes suggest; but they are both equally
devoid of foundation.  The one is an idle tale; and there could be no
solid reason for concealing the circumstances of discoveries, whose
arrangements and prosecution were so honourable to my associates and
myself, at whose expense they were undertaken.  The delay actually arose
from the very active and busy mode of life in which I was engaged since
the voyages have been completed; and when, at length, the opportunity
arrived, the apprehension of presenting myself to the Public in the
character of an Author, for which the courses and occupations of my life
have by no means qualified me, made me hesitate in committing my papers
to the Press; being much better calculated to perform the voyages,
arduous as they might be, than to write an account of them.  However,
they are now offered to the Public with the submission that becomes me.</p>

<p>I was led, at an early period of life, by commercial views, to the
country North-West of Lake Superior, in North America, and being endowed
by Nature with an inquisitive mind and enterprising spirit; possessing
also a constitution and frame of body equal to the most arduous
undertakings, and being familiar with toilsome exertions in the
prosecution of mercantile pursuits, I not only contemplated the
practicability of penetrating across the continent of America, but was
confident in the qualifications, as I was animated by the desire, to
undertake the perilous enterprise.</p>

<p>The general utility of such a discovery, has been universally
acknowledged; while the wishes of my particular friends and commercial
associates, that I should proceed in the pursuit of it, contributed to
quicken the execution of this favourite project of my own ambition: and
as the completion of it extends the boundaries of geographic science,
and adds new countries to the realms of British
 commerce, the
dangers I have encountered, and the toils I have suffered, have found their
recompence; nor will the many tedious and weary days, or the gloomy and
inclement nights which I have passed, have been passed in vain.</p>

<p>The first voyage has settled the dubious point of a practicable
North-West passage; and I trust it has set that long agitated question
at rest, and extinguished the disputes respecting it for ever.  An
enlarged discussion of that subject will be found to occupy the
concluding pages of this volume.</p>

<p>In this voyage, I was not only without the necessary books and
instruments, but also felt myself deficient in the sciences of astronomy
and navigation; I did not hesitate, therefore, to undertake a winter's
voyage to this country, in order to procure the one, and acquire the
other.  These objects being accomplished, I returned, to determine the
practicability of a commercial communication through the continent of
North America, between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, which is proved
by my second journal.  Nor do I hesitate to declare my decided opinion,
that very great and essential advantages may be derived by extending our
trade from one sea to the other.</p>

<p>Some account of the fur trade of Canada from that country, of the native
inhabitants, and of
the extensive districts connected with it, forms a
preliminary discourse, which will, I trust, prove interesting to a
nation, whose general policy is blended with, and whose prosperity is
supported by, the pursuits of commerce.  It will also qualify the reader
to pursue the succeeding voyages with superior intelligence and
satisfaction.</p>

<p>These voyages will not, I fear, afford the variety that may be expected
from them; and that which they offered to the eye, is not of a nature to
be effectually transferred to the page.  Mountains and valleys, the
dreary waste, and the wide-spreading forests, the lakes and rivers
succeed each other in general description; and, except on the coasts of
the Pacific Ocean, where the villages were permanent, and the
inhabitants in a great measure stationary, small bands of wandering
Indians are the only people whom I shall introduce to the acquaintance
of my readers.</p>

<p>The beaver and the buffalo, the moose-deer and the elk, which are the
principal animals to be found in these countries, are already so
familiar to the naturalists of Europe, and have been so often as well as
correctly described in their works, that the bare mention of them, as
they enlivened the landscape, or were hunted for food; with a cursory
account of the soil, the course and navigation of lakes and rivers, and
their various produce, 
is all that can be reasonably expected from me.</p>

<p>I do not possess the science of the naturalist; and even if the
qualifications of that character had been attained by me, its curious
spirit would not have been gratified.  I could not stop to dig into the
earth, over whose surface I was compelled to pass with rapid steps; nor
could I turn aside to collect the plants which nature might have
scattered on the way, when my thoughts were anxiously employed in making
provision for the day that was passing over me.  I had to encounter
perils by land and perils by water; to watch the savage who was our
guide, or to guard against those of his tribe who might meditate our
destruction.  I had, also, the passions and fears of others to control
and subdue.  To-day, I had to assuage the rising discontents, and on the
morrow, to cheer the fainting spirits of the people who accompanied me.
The toil of our navigation was incessant, and oftentimes extreme; and in
our progress over land, we had no protection from the severity of the
elements, and possessed no accommodations or conveniences but such as
could be contained in the burden on our shoulders, which aggravated the
toils of our march, and added to the wearisomeness of our way.</p>

<p>Though the events which compose my
 journals may have
little in themselves to strike the imagination of those who love to be
astonished, or to gratify the curiosity of such as are enamoured of
romantic adventures; nevertheless, when it is considered, that I
explored those waters which had never before borne any other vessel than
the canoe of the savage; and traversed those deserts where an European
had never before presented himself to the eye of its swarthy natives;
when to these considerations are added the important objects which were
pursued, with the dangers that were encountered, and the difficulties
that were surmounted to attain them, this work will, I flatter myself,
be found to excite an interest, and conciliate regard, in the minds of
those who peruse it.</p>

<p>The general map which illustrates this volume, is reduced by
Mr. Arrowsmith from his three-sheet map of North America, with the
latest discoveries, which he is about to republish.  His professional
abilities are well known, and no encomium of mine will advance the
general and merited opinion of them.</p>

<p>Before I conclude, I must beg leave to inform my readers, that they are
not to expect the charms of embellished narrative, or animated
description; the approbation due to simplicity and to truth, is all I
presume to claim; and I am not without the hope that this claim will be
allowed me.  I have 
described whatever I saw with the impressions of the
moment which presented it to me.  The successive circumstances of my
progress are related without exaggeration or display.  I have seldom
allowed myself to wander into conjecture; and whenever conjecture has
been indulged, it will be found, I trust, to be accompanied with the
temper of a man who is not disposed to think too highly of himself: and
if, at any time, I have delivered myself with confidence, it will
appear, I hope, to be on those subjects, which, from the habits and
experience of my life, will justify an unreserved communication of my
opinions.  I am not a candidate for literary fame; at the same time, I
cannot but indulge the hope that this volume, with all its
imperfections, will not be thought unworthy the attention of the
scientific geographer; and that, by unfolding countries hitherto
unexplored, and which, I presume, may now be considered as a part of the
British dominions, it will be received as a faithful tribute to the
prosperity of my country.</p>

<h2> A GENERAL HISTORY OF THE FUR TRADE
FROM CANADA TO THE NORTH-WEST.</h2>

<p>The fur trade, from the earliest settlement of Canada, was considered of
the first importance to that colony.  The country was then so populous,
that, in the vicinity of the establishments, the animals whose skins
were precious, in a commercial view, soon became very scarce, if not
altogether extinct.  They were, it is true, hunted at former periods,
but merely for food and clothing.  The Indians, therefore, to procure
the necessary supply, were encouraged, to penetrate into the country,
and were generally accompanied by some of the Canadians, who found means
to induce the remotest tribes of natives to bring the skins which were
most in demand, to their settlements, in the way of trade.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for me to examine the cause, but experience proves
that it requires much less time for a civilized people to deviate into
the manners and customs of savage life, than for savages to rise into a
state of civilization.  Such was the event with those who thus
accompanied the natives on their hunting and trading excursions; for
they became so attached to the Indian mode of life, that they lost all
relish for their former habits and native homes.  Hence they derived the
title of <i>Coureurs des Bois</i>, became a kind of pedlars, and were
extremely useful to the merchants engaged in the fur trade; who gave
them the necessary credit to proceed on their commercial undertakings.
Three or four of these people would join their stock, put their property
into a birch-bark canoe, which they worked themselves, and either
accompanied the natives in their excursions, or went at once to the
country where they knew they were to hunt.  At length, these voyages
extended to twelve or fifteen months, when they returned with rich
cargoes of furs, and followed by great numbers of the natives.  During
the short time requisite to settle their accounts with the merchants,
and procure fresh credit, they generally contrived to squander away all
their gains, when they returned to renew their favourite mode of life:
their views being answered, and their labour sufficiently rewarded, by
indulging themselves in extravagance and dissipation, during the short
space of one month in twelve or fifteen.</p>

<p>This indifference about amassing property, and the pleasure of living
free from all 
restraint, soon brought on a licentiousness of manners
which could not long escape the vigilant observation of the
missionaries, who had much reason to complain of their being a disgrace
to the Christian religion; by not only swerving from its duties
themselves, but by thus bringing it into disrepute with those of the
natives who had become converts to it; and, consequently, obstructing
the great object to which those pious men had devoted their lives.  They
therefore exerted their influence to procure the suppression of these
people, and accordingly, no one was allowed to go up the country to
traffic with the Indians, without a license from the government.</p>

<p>At first these permissions were, of course, granted only to those whose
character was such as could give no alarm to the zeal of the
missionaries: but they were afterwards bestowed as rewards for services,
on officers, and their widows; and they, who were not willing or able to
make use of them (which may be supposed to be always the case with those
of the latter description), were allowed to sell them to the merchants,
who necessarily employed the Coureurs des bois, in quality of their
agents; and these people, as may be imagined, gave sufficient cause for
the renewal of former complaints; so that the remedy proved, in fact,
worse than the disease.</p>

<p>At length, military posts were established  at the confluence of the
different large lakes of Canada, which, in a great measure checked the
evil consequences that followed from the improper conduct of these
foresters, and, at the same time, protected the trade.  Besides, a
number of able and respectable men, retired from the army, prosecuted
the trade in person, under their respective licences, with great order
and regularity, and extended it to such a distance, as, in those days,
was considered to be an astonishing effort of commercial enterprize.
These persons and the missionaries having combined their views at the
same time, secured the respect of the natives, and the obedience of the
people necessarily employed in the laborious parts of this undertaking.
These gentlemen denominated themselves commanders, and not traders,
though they were entitled to both those characters: and, as for the
missionaries, if sufferings and hardships in the prosecution of the
great work which they had undertaken, deserved applause and admiration,
they had an undoubted claim to be admired and applauded: they spared no
labour and avoided no danger in the execution of their important office;
and it is to be seriously lamented, that their pious endeavours did not
meet with the success which they deserved: for there is hardly a trace
to be found beyond the cultivated parts, of their meritorious functions.</p>

<p> The cause of this
failure must be attributed to a want of due
consideration in the mode employed by the missionaries, to propagate the
religion of which they were the zealous ministers.  They habituated
themselves to the savage life, and naturalized themselves to the savage
manners, and, by thus becoming dependent, as it were, on the natives,
they acquired their contempt rather than their veneration.  If they had
been as well acquainted with human nature, as they were with the
articles of their faith, they would have known that the uncultivated
mind of an Indian must be disposed by much preparatory method and
instruction to receive the revealed truths of Christianity, to act under
its sanctions, and be impelled to good by the hope of its reward, or
turned from evil by the fear of its punishments.  They should have begun
their work by teaching some of those useful arts which are the inlets of
knowledge, and lead the mind by degrees to objects of higher
comprehension.  Agriculture, so formed to fix and combine society, and
so preparatory to objects of superior consideration, should have been
the first thing introduced among a savage people: it attaches the
wandering tribe to that spot where it adds so much to their comforts;
while it gives them a sense of property, and of lasting possession,
instead of the uncertain hopes of the chase, and the  fugitive produce of
uncultivated wilds.  Such were the means by which the forests of
Paraguay were converted into a scene of abundant cultivation, and its
savage inhabitants introduced to all the advantages of a civilized life.</p>

<p>The Canadian missionaries should have been contented to improve the
morals of their own countrymen, so that by meliorating their character
and conduct, they would have given a striking example of the effect of
religion in promoting the comforts of life to the surrounding savages;
and might by degrees have extended its benign influence to the remotest
regions of that country, which was the object, and intended to be the
scene, of their evangelical labours.  But by bearing the light of the
Gospel at once to the distance of two thousand five hundred miles from
the civilized part of the colonies, it was soon obscured by the cloud of
ignorance that darkened the human mind in those distant regions.</p>

<p>The whole of their long route I have often travelled, and the
recollection of such a people as the missionaries having been there, was
confined to a few superannuated Canadians, who had not left that country
since the cession to the English, in 1763, and who particularly
mentioned the death of some, and the distressing situation of them all.
But if these religious men did not attain the objects of their
persevering piety, they were, during  their mission, of great service to
the commanders who engaged in those distant expeditions, and spread the
fur trade as far West as the banks of the Saskatchiwine river, in
53. North latitude, and longitude 102. West.</p>

<p> At an early period of their intercourse with the savages, a custom was
introduced of a very excellent tendency, but is now unfortunately
discontinued, of not selling any spirituous liquor to the natives.  This
admirable regulation was for some time observed, with all the respect
due to the religion by which it was sanctioned, and whose severest
censures followed the violation of it.  A painful penance could alone
restore the offender to the suspended rites of the sacrament.  The
casuistry of trade, however, discovered a way to gratify the Indians
with their favourite cordial without incurring the ecclesiastical
penalties, by giving, instead of selling it to them.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding all the restrictions with which commerce was
oppressed under the French government, the fur trade was extended to the
immense distance which has been already stated; and surmounted many most
discouraging difficulties, which will be hereafter noticed; while, at
the same time, no exertions were made from Hudson's Bay to obtain even a
share of the trade of a country, which according to the charter of that
company, belonged to it, and, from its proximity, is so much more
accessible to the mercantile adventurer.</p>

<p>Of these trading commanders, I understood, that two attempted to
penetrate to the Pacific Ocean, but the utmost extent of their journey I
could never learn; which may be attributed, indeed, to a failure of the
undertaking.</p>

<p>For some time after the conquest of Canada, this trade was suspended,
which must have been very advantageous to the Hudson's-Bay Company, as
all the inhabitants to the westward of Lake Superior were obliged to go
to them for such articles as their habitual use had rendered necessary.
Some of the Canadians who had lived long with them, and were become
attached to a savage life, accompanied them thither annually, till
mercantile adventurers again appeared from their own country, after an
interval of several years, owing, as I suppose, to an ignorance of the
country in the conquerors, and their want of commercial confidence in
the conquered.  There were, indeed, other discouragements, such as the
immense length of the journey necessary to reach the limits beyond which
this commerce must begin; the risk of property; the expenses attending
such a long transport; and an ignorance of the language of those who,
from their experience, must be necessarily employed as the intermediate
agents between them and the natives.  But,  notwithstanding these
difficulties, the trade, by degrees, began to spread over the different
parts to which it had been carried by the French, though at a great risk
of the lives, as well as the property of their new possessors, for the
natives had been taught by their former allies to entertain hostile
dispositions towards the English, from their having been in alliance
with their natural enemies the Iroquois; and there were not wanting a
sufficient number of discontented, disappointed people, to keep alive
such a notion; so that for a long time they were considered and treated
as objects of hostility.  To prove this disposition of the Indians, we
have only to refer to the conduct of Pontiac, at Detroit, and the
surprise and taking of Michilimakinac, about this period.</p>

<p>Hence it arose, that it was so late as the year 1766, before which, the
trade I mean to consider, commenced from Michilimakinac.  The first who
attempted it were satisfied to go the length of the river Camenistiquia,
about thirty miles to the Eastward of the Grande Portage, where the
French had a principal establishment, and was the line of their
communication with the interior country.  It was once destroyed by fire.
Here they went and returned successful in the following spring to
Michilimakinac.  Their success induced them to renew their journey,
 and
incited others to follow their example.  Some of them remained at
Camenistiquia, while others proceeded to and beyond the Grande Portage,
which, since that time has become the principal entrepot of that trade,
and is situated in a bay, in latitude 48. North, and longitude 90. West.
After passing the usual season there, they went back to Michilimakinac
as before, and encouraged by the trade, returned in increased numbers.
One of these, Thomas Curry, with a spirit of enterprize superior to that
of his contemporaries, determined to penetrate to the furthest limits of
the French discoveries in that country; or at least till the frost
should stop him.  For this purpose he procured guides and interpreters,
who were acquainted with the country, and with four canoes arrived at
Fort Bourbon, which was one of their posts, at the West end of the Cedar
Lake, on the waters of the Saskatchiwine.  His risk and toil were well
recompensed, for he came back the following spring with his canoes
filled with fine furs, with which he proceeded to Canada, and was
satisfied never again to return to the Indian country.</p>

<p>From this period, people began to spread over every part of the country,
particularly where the French had established settlements.</p>

<p>Mr. James Finlay was the first who followed Mr.  Curry's example, and
with the  same
number of canoes, arrived, in the course of the next
season, at Nipawee, the last of the French settlements on the bank of
the Saskatchiwine river, in latitude nearly 43½. North, and longitude
103. West: he found the good fortune, as he followed, in every respect,
the example, of his predecessor.</p>

<p>As may be supposed, there were now people enough ready to replace them,
and the trade was pursued with such avidity, and irregularity, that in a
few years it became the reverse of what it ought to have been.  An
animated competition prevailed, and the contending parties carried the
trade beyond the French limits, though with no benefit to themselves or
neighbours, the Hudson's-Bay Company; who in the year 1774, and not till
then, thought proper to move from home to the East bank of Sturgeon
Lake, in latitude 53. 56. North, and longitude 102. 15. West, and became
more jealous of their fellow subjects; and, perhaps, with more cause,
than they had been of those of France.  From this period, to the present
time, they have been following the Canadians to their different
establishments, while, on the contrary, there is not a solitary instance
that the Canadians have followed them; and there are many trading posts
which they have not yet attained.  This, however, will no longer be a
mystery, when the nature and policy of the  Hudson's-Bay Company is
compared with that, which has been pursued by their rivals in this
trade.—But to return to my subject.</p>

<p>This competition, which has been already mentioned, gave a fatal blow to
the trade from Canada, and, with other incidental causes, in my opinion,
contributed to its ruin.  This trade was carried on in a very distant
country, out of the reach of legal restraint, and where there was a free
scope given to any ways or means in attaining advantage.  The
consequence was not only the loss of commercial benefit to the persons
engaged in it, but of the good opinion of the natives, and the respect
of their men, who were inclined to follow their example; so that with
drinking, carousing, and quarrelling with the Indians along their route,
and among themselves, they seldom reached their winter quarters; and if
they did, it was generally by dragging their property upon sledges, as
the navigation was closed up by the frost.  When at length they were
arrived, the object of each was to injure his rival traders in the
opinion of the natives as much as was in their power, by
misrepresentation and presents, for which the agents employed were
peculiarly calculated.  They considered the command of their employer as
binding on them, and however wrong or irregular the transaction, the
responsibility rested with the principal  who directed them.  This is
Indian law.  Thus did they waste their credit and their property with
the natives, till the first was past redemption, and the last was nearly
exhausted; so that towards the spring in each year, the rival parties
found it absolutely necessary to join, and make one common stock of what
remained, for the purpose of trading with the natives, who could
entertain no respect for persons who had conducted themselves with so
much irregularity and deceit.  The winter, therefore, was one continued
scene of disagreements and quarrels, If any one had the precaution or
good sense to keep clear of these proceedings, he derived a
proportionable advantage from his good conduct, and frequently proved a
peacemaker between the parties.  To such an height had they carried this
licentious conduct, that they were in a continual state of alarm, and
were even frequently stopped to pay tribute on their route into the
country; though they had adopted the plan of travelling together in
parties of thirty or forty canoes, and keeping their men armed; which
sometimes, indeed, proved necessary for their defence.</p>

<p>Thus was the trade carried on for several years, and consequently
becoming worse and worse, so that the partners, who met them at the
Grande Portage, naturally complained of their ill success.  But specious
reasons were  always
ready to prove that it arose from circumstances
which they could not at that time control; and encouragements were held
forth to hope that a change would soon take place, which would make
ample amends for past disappointments.</p>

<p>It was about this time, that Mr. Joseph Frobisher, one of the gentlemen
engaged in the trade, determined to penetrate into the country yet
unexplored, to the North and Westward, and, in the spring of the year
1775, met the Indians from that quarter on their way to Fort Churchill,
at Portage de Traite, so named from that circumstance, on the banks of
the Missinipi, or Churchill river, latitude 55. 25. North, longitude
103½. West.  It was indeed, with some difficulty that he could induce
them to trade with him, but he at length procured as many furs as his
canoes could carry.  In this perilous expedition he sustained every kind
of hardship incident to a journey through a wild and savage country,
where his subsistence depended on what the woods and the waters
produced.  These difficulties, nevertheless, did not discourage him from
returning in the following year, when he was equally successful.  He
then sent his brother to explore the country still further West, who
penetrated as far as the lake of Isle a la Crosse, in latitude
55. 26. North, and longitude 108. West.</p>

<p> He, however,
never after wintered among the Indians, though he retained
a large interest in the trade, and a principal share in the direction of
it till the year 1798, when he retired to enjoy the fruits of his
labours; and, by his hospitality, became known to every respectable
stranger who visited Canada.</p>

<p>The success of this gentleman induced others to follow his example, and
in the spring of the year 1778, some of the traders on the Saskatchiwine
river, finding they had a quantity of goods to spare, agreed to put them
into a joint stock, and gave the charge and management of them to
Mr. Peter Pond, who, in four canoes, was directed to enter the English
River, so called by Mr. Frobisher, to follow his track, and proceed
still further; if possible, to Athabasca, a country hitherto unknown but
from Indian report.  In this enterprise he at length succeeded and
pitched his tent on the banks of the Elk river, by him erroneously
called the Athabasca river, about forty miles from the Lake of the
Hills, into which it empties itself.</p>

<p>Here he passed the winter of 1778-9; saw a vast concourse of the
Knisteneaux and Chepewyan tribes, who used to carry their furs annually
to Churchill; the latter by the barren grounds, where they suffered
innumerable hardships, and were sometimes even starved to death.  The former
followed the  course
of the lakes and rivers, through a country
that abounded in animals, and where there was plenty of fish: but though
they did not suffer from want of food, the intolerable fatigue of such a
journey could not be easily repaid to an Indian: they were, therefore,
highly gratified by seeing people come to their country to relieve them
from such long, toilsome, and dangerous journeys; and were immediately
reconciled to give an advanced price for the articles necessary to their
comfort and convenience.  Mr.  Pond's reception and success was
accordingly beyond his expectation; and he procured twice as many furs
as his canoes would carry.  They also supplied him with as much
provision as he required during his residence among them, and sufficient
for his homeward voyage.  Such of the furs as he could not embark, he
secured in one of his winter huts, and they were found the following
season, in the same state in which he left them.</p>

<p>These, however, were but partial advantages, and could not prevent the
people of Canada from seeing the improper conduct of some of their
associates, which rendered it dangerous to remain any longer among the
natives.  Most of them who passed the winter at the Saskatchiwine, got
to the Eagle hills, where, in the spring of the year 1780, a few days
previous to their intended departure, a  large band of Indians being
engaged in drinking about their houses, one of the traders, to ease
himself of the troublesome importunities of a native, gave him a dose of
laudanum in a glass of grog, which effectually prevented him from giving
further trouble to any one, by setting him asleep for ever.  This
accident produced a fray, in which one of the traders, and several of
the men were killed, while the rest had no other means to save
themselves but by a precipitate flight, abandoning a considerable
quantity of goods, and near half the furs which they had collected
during the winter and the spring.</p>

<p>About the same time, two of the establishments on the Assiniboin river,
were attacked with less justice, when several white men, and a great
number of Indians were killed.  In short, it appeared, that the natives
had formed a resolution to extirpate the traders; and, without entering
into any further reasonings on the subject, it appears to be
incontrovertible, that the irregularity pursued in carrying on the trade
has brought it into its present forlorn situation; and nothing but the
greatest calamity that could have befallen the natives, saved the
traders from destruction: this was the small-pox, which spread its
destructive and desolating power, as the fire consumes the dry grass of
the field.  The fatal infection spread around with a baneful  rapidity
which no flight could escape, and with a fatal effect that nothing could
resist.  It destroyed with its pestilential breath whole families and
tribes; and the horrid scene presented to those who had the melancholy
and afflicting opportunity of beholding it, a combination of the dead,
the dying, and such as to avoid the horrid fate of their friends around
them, prepared to disappoint the plague of its prey, by terminating their
own existence.</p>

<p>The habits and lives of these devoted people, which provided not to-day
for the wants of to-morrow, must have heightened the pains of such an
affliction, by leaving them not only without remedy, but even without
alleviation.  Naught was left them but to submit in agony and despair.</p>

<p>To aggravate the picture, if aggravation were possible, may be added,
the putrid carcases which the wolves, with a furious voracity, dragged
forth from the huts, or which were mangled within them by the dogs,
whose hunger was satisfied with the disfigured remains of their masters.
Nor was it uncommon for the father of a family, whom the infection had
not reached, to call them around him to represent the cruel sufferings
and horrid fate of their relations, from the influence of some evil
spirit who was preparing to extirpate their race; and to incite them to
 baffle death,
with all its horrors, by their own poniards.  At the same
time, if their hearts failed them in this necessary act, he was himself
ready to perform the deed of mercy with his own hand, as the last act of
his affection, and instantly to follow them to the common place of rest
and refuge from human evil.</p>

<p>It was never satisfactorily ascertained by what means this malignant
disorder was introduced, but it was generally supposed to be from the
Missisouri, by a war party.</p>

<p>The consequence of this melancholy event to the traders must be
self-evident; the means of disposing of their goods were cut off; and no
furs were obtained, but such as had been gathered from the habitations
of the deceased Indians, which could not be very considerable: nor did
they look from the losses of the present year, with any encouraging
expectations to those which were to come.  The only fortunate people
consisted of a party who had again penetrated to the Northward and
Westward in 1780, at some distance up the Missinipi, or English river,
to Lake la Ronge.  Two unfortunate circumstances, however, happened to
them; which are as follow:</p>

<p>Mr. Wadin, a Swiss gentleman, of strict probity and known sobriety, had
gone there in the year 1779, and remained during the
 summer of 1780.
His partners and others, engaged in an opposite interest, when at the
Grande Portage, agreed to send a quantity of goods on their joint
account, which was accepted, and Mr. Pond was proposed by them to be
their representative to act in conjunction with Mr. Wadin.  Two men, of
more opposite characters, could not, perhaps, have been found.  In
short, from various causes, their situations became very uncomfortable
to each other, and mutual ill-will was the natural consequence: without
entering, therefore, into a minute history of these transactions, it
will be sufficient to observe, that, about the end of the year 1780, or
the beginning of 1781, Mr. Wadin had received Mr. Pond and one of his
own clerks to dinner; and, in the course of the night, the former was
shot through the lower part of the thigh, when it was said that he
expired from the loss of blood, and was buried next morning at eight
o'clock.  Mr. Pond, and the clerk, were tried for this murder at
Montreal, and acquitted: nevertheless, their innocence was not so
apparent as to extinguish the original suspicion.</p>

<p>The other circumstance was this.  In the spring of the year, Mr. Pond
sent the abovementioned clerk to meet the Indians from the Northward,
who used to go annually to Hudson's Bay; when he easily persuaded them
to  trade with him,
and return back, that they might not take the
contagion which had depopulated the country to the Eastward of them: but
most unfortunately they caught it here, and carried it with them, to the
destruction of themselves and the neighbouring tribes.</p>

<p>The country being thus depopulated, the traders and their friends from
Canada, who, from various causes already mentioned, were very much
reduced in number, became confined to two parties, who began seriously
to think of making permanent establishments on the Missinipi river, and
at Athabasca; for which purpose, in 1781-2, they selected their best
canoe-men, being ignorant that the small-pox penetrated that way.  The
most expeditious party got only in time to the Portage la Loche, or
Mithy-Ouinigam, which divides the waters of the Missinipi from those
that fall into the Elk river, to despatch one canoe strong-handed, and
light-loaded, to that country; but, on their arrival there, they found,
in every direction, the ravages of the small-pox; so that, from the
great diminution of the natives, they returned in the spring with no
more than seven packages of beaver.  The strong woods and mountainous
countries afforded a refuge to those who fled from the contagion of the
plains; but they were so alarmed at the surrounding destruction, that
they avoided the traders, and were dispirited  from hunting, except for
their subsistence.  The traders, however, who returned into the country
in the year 1782-3, found the inhabitants in some sort of tranquillity,
and more numerous than they had reason to expect, so that their success
was proportionably better.</p>

<p>During the winter of 1783-4, the merchants of Canada, engaged in this
trade, formed a junction of interests, under the name of the North-West
Company, and divided it into sixteen shares, without depositing any
capital; each party furnishing a proportion or quota of such articles as
were necessary to carry on the trade: the respective parties agreeing to
satisfy the friends they had in the country, who were not provided for,
according to this agreement, out of the proportions which they held.
The management of the whole was accordingly entrusted to
Messrs. Benjamin and Joseph Frobisher, and Mr. Simon M'Tavish, two
distinct houses, who had the greatest interest and influence in the
country, and for which they were to receive a stipulated commission in
all transactions.</p>

<p>In the spring, two of those gentlemen went to the Grande Portage with
their credentials, which were confirmed and ratified by all the parties
having an option, except Mr. Peter Pond, who was not satisfied with the
share  allotted him.
Accordingly he, and another gentleman, Mr. Peter
Pangman, who had a right to be a partner, but for whom no provision had
been made, came to Canada, with a determination to return to the
country, if they could find any persons to join them, and give their
scheme a proper support.</p>

<p>The traders in the country, and merchants at Montreal, thus entered into
a co-partnership, which, by these means, was consolidated and directed
by able men, who, from the powers with which they were entrusted, would
carry on the trade to the utmost extent it would bear.  The traders in
the country, therefore, having every reason to expect that their past
and future labours would be recompensed, forgot all their former
animosities, and engaged with the utmost spirit and activity, to forward
the general interest; so that, in the following year, they met their
agents at the Grande Portage, with their canoes laden with rich furs
from the different parts of that immense tract of country.  But this
satisfaction was not to be enjoyed without some interruption; and they
were mortified to find that Mr. Pangman had prevailed on Messrs. Gregory
and Macleod to join him, and give him their support in the business,
though deserted by Mr. Pond, who accepted the terms offered by his
former associates.</p>

<p>In the counting-house of Mr. Gregory I  had been five years; and at this
period had left him, with a small adventure of goods, with which he had
entrusted me, to seek my fortune at Detroit.  He, without any
solicitation on my part, had procured an insertion in the agreement,
that I should be admitted a partner in this business, on condition that
I would proceed to the Indian country in the following spring, 1785.
His partner came to Detroit to make me such a proposition.  I readily
assented to it, and immediately proceeded to the Grande Portage, where I
joined my associates.</p>

<p>We now found that independent of the natural difficulties of the
undertaking, we should have to encounter every other which they, who
were already in possession of the trade of the country, could throw in
our way, and which their circumstances enabled them to do.  Nor did they
doubt, from their own superior experience, as well as that of their
clerks and men, with their local knowledge of the country and its
inhabitants, that they should soon compel us to leave the country to
them.  The event, however, did not justify their expectations; for,
after the severest struggle ever known in that part of the world, and
suffering every oppression which a jealous and rival spirit could
instigate; after the murder of one of our partners, the laming of
another, and the narrow escape of one of our  clerks, who received a
bullet through his powder horn, in the execution of his duty, they were
compelled to allow us a share of the trade.  As we had already incurred
a loss, this union was, in every respect, a desirable event to us, and
was concluded in the month of July, 1787.</p>

<p>This commercial establishment was now founded on a more solid basis than
any hitherto known in the country; and it not only continued in full
force, vigour, and prosperity, in spite of all interference from Canada,
but maintained at least an equal share of advantage with the
Hudson's-Bay Company, notwithstanding the superiority of their local
situation.  The following account of this self-erected concern will
manifest the cause of its success.</p>

<p>It assumed the title of the North-West Company, and was no more than an
association of commercial men, agreeing among themselves to carry on the
fur trade, unconnected with any other business, though many of the
parties engaged had extensive concerns altogether foreign to it.  It may
be said to have been supported entirely upon credit; for, whether the
capital belonged to the proprietor, or was borrowed, it equally bore
interest, for which the association was annually accountable.  It
consisted of twenty shares, unequally divided among the persons
 concerned.
Of these, a certain proportion was held by the people who
managed the business in Canada, and were styled agents for the Company.
Their duty was to import the necessary goods from England, store them at
their own expense at Montreal, get them made up into articles suited to
the trade, pack and forward them, and supply the cash that might be
wanting for the outfits, for which they received, independent of the
profit on their shares, a commission on the amount of the accounts,
which they were obliged to make out annually, and keep the adventure of
each year distinct.  Two of them went annually to the Grande Portage, to
manage and transact the business there, and on the communication at
Detroit, Michilimakinac, St. Mary's, and at Montreal, where they
received, stored, packed up, and shipped the company's furs for England,
on which they had also a small commission.  The remaining shares were
held by the proprietors, who were obliged to winter and manage the
business of the concern with the Indians, and their respective clerks,
etc.  They were not supposed to be under any obligation to furnish
capital, or even credit.  If they obtained any capital by the trade, it
was to remain in the hands of the agents; for which they were allowed
interest.  Some of them, from their long services and influence, held
double  shares,
and were allowed to retire from the business at any
period of the existing concern, with one of those shares, naming any
young man in the company's service to succeed him in the other.
Seniority and merit were, however, considered as affording a claim to
the succession, which, nevertheless, could not be disposed of without
the concurrence of the majority of the concern; who, at the same time,
relieved the seceding person from any responsibility respecting the
share that he transferred, and accounted for it according to the annual
value or rate of the property; so that the seller could have no
advantage, but that of getting the share of stock which he retained
realised, and receiving for the transferred share what was fairly
determined to be the worth of it.  The former was also discharged from
all duty, and became a dormant partner.  Thus, all the young men who
were not provided for at the beginning of the contract, succeeded in
succession to the character and advantages of partners.  They entered
into the Company's service for five or seven years, under such
expectations, and their reasonable prospects were seldom disappointed:
there were, indeed, instances when they succeeded to shares, before
their apprenticeship was expired, and it frequently happened, that they
were provided for while they were in a state of articled clerkship.
Shares  were
transferable only to the concern at large, as no person
could be admitted as a partner who had not served his time to the trade.
The dormant partner indeed might dispose of his interest to any one he
chose, but if the transaction was not acknowledged by his associates,
the purchaser could only be considered as his agent or attorney.  Every
share had a vote, and two-thirds formed a majority.  This regular and
equitable mode of providing for the clerks of the company, excited a
spirit of emulation in the discharge of their various duties, and in
fact, made every agent a principal, who perceived his own prosperity to
be immediately connected with that of his employers.  Indeed, without
such a spirit, such a trade could not have become so extended and
advantageous, as it has been and now is.</p>

<p>In 1788, the gross amount of the adventure for the year did not exceed
forty thousand pounds,<a name="hl1" href="#hr1">[1]</a> but by the exertion,
enterprise, and industry of the proprietors, it was brought, in eleven years,
to triple that amount and upwards; yielding proportionate profits, and
 surpassing, in
short, any thing known in America.</p>

<p>Such, therefore, being the prosperous state of the company, it, very
naturally, tempted others to interfere with the concern in a manner by
no means beneficial to the company, and commonly ruinous to the
undertakers.</p>

<p>In 1798 the concern underwent a new form, the shares were increased to
forty-six, new partners being admitted, and others retiring.  This
period was the termination of the company, which was not renewed by all
the parties concerned in it, the majority continuing to act upon the old
stock, and under the old firm; the others beginning a new one; and it
now remains to be decided, whether two parties, under the same
regulations and by the same exertions, though unequal in number, can
continue to carry on the business to a successful issue.  The contrary
opinion has been held, which if verified, will make it the interest of
the parties again to coalesce; for neither is deficient in capital to
support their obstinacy in a losing trade, as it is not to be supposed
that either will yield on any other terms than perpetual participation.</p>

<p>It will not be superfluous in this place, to explain the general mode of
carrying on the fur trade.</p>

<p>The agents are obliged to order the  necessary goods from England in the month of October,
eighteen months before they can leave Montreal; that is, they are not
shipped from London until the spring following, when they arrive in
Canada in the summer.  In the course of the following winter they are
made up into such articles as are required for the savages; they are
then packed into parcels of ninety pounds weight each, but cannot be
sent from Montreal until the May following; so that they do not get to
market until the ensuing winter, when they are exchanged for furs, which
come to Montreal the next fall, and from thence are shipped, chiefly to
London, where they are not sold or paid for before the succeeding
spring, or even as late as June; which is forty-two months after the
goods were ordered in Canada; thirty-six after they had been shipped
from England, and twenty-four after they had been forwarded from
Montreal; so that the merchant, allowing that he has twelve months'
credit, does not receive a return to pay for those goods, and the
necessary expenses attending them, which is about equal to the value of
the goods themselves, till two years after they are considered as cash,
which makes this a very heavy business.  There is even a small
proportion of it that requires twelve months longer to bring
round  the payment,
going to, the immense distance it is carried, and from the shortness of
the seasons, which prevents the furs, even after they are collected,
from coming out of the country for that period.<a name="hl2" href="#hr2">[2]</a></p>

<p>The articles necessary for this trade, are coarse woollen cloths of
different kinds; milled blankets of different sizes; arms and
ammunition; twist and carrot tobacco; Manchester goods; linens, and
coarse sheetings; thread, lines, and twine; common hardware; cutlery and
ironmongery of several descriptions; kettles of brass and copper, and
sheet-iron; silk and cotton handkerchiefs, hats, shoes, and hose;
calicoes and printed cottons, etc., etc., etc.  Spirituous liquors and
provisions are purchased in Canada.  These, and the expense of transport
to and from the Indian country, including wages to clerks, interpreters,
guides, and canoe-men, with the expense of making up the goods for the
 market, form about
half the annual amount against the adventure.</p>

<p>This expenditure in Canada ultimately tends to the encouragement of
British manufactory, for those who are employed in the different
branches of this business, are enabled by their gains to purchase such
British articles as they must otherwise forego.</p>

<p>The produce of the year of which I am now speaking, consisted of the
following furs and peltries:</p>
<pre>
 106,000 Beaver skins,      6,000 Lynx skins,
   2,100 Bear skins,          600 Wolverine skins,
   1,500 Fox skins,         1,650 Fisher skins,
   4,000 Kitt Fox skins       100 Rackoon skins,
   4,600 Otter skins,       8,800 Wolf skins,
  17,000 Musquash skins,      700 Elk skins,
  32,000 Marten skins,        750 Deer skins,
   1,800 Mink skins,        1,200 Deer skins dressed,
     500 Buffalo robes, and quantity of castorum.
</pre>
<p>Of these were diverted from the British market, being sent through the
United States to China, 13,364 skins, fine beaver, weighing 19,283
pounds; 1,250 fine otters, and 1,724 kitt foxes.  They would have found
their way to the China market at any rate, but this deviation from the
British channel arose from the following circumstance:</p>

<p>An adventure of this kind was undertaken by a respectable house in
London, half 
concerned with the North-West Company, in the year 1792.
The furs were of the best kind, and suitable to the market; and the
adventurers continued this connexion for five successive years, to the
annual amount of forty thousand pounds.  At the winding up of the
concern of 1792, 1793, 1794, 1795, in the year 1797 (the adventure of
1796 not being included, as the furs were not sent to China, but
disposed of in London), the North-West Company experienced a loss of
upwards of £40,000 (their half), which was principally owing to
the difficulty of getting home the produce procured in return for the
furs from China, in the East India Company's ships, together with the
duty payable, and the various restrictions of that company.  Whereas,
from America there are no impediments; they get immediately to market,
and the produce of them is brought back, and perhaps sold in the course
of twelve months.  From such advantages, the furs of Canada will no
doubt find their way to China by America, which would not be the case if
British subjects had the same privileges that are allowed to foreigners,
as London would then be found the best and safest market.</p>

<p>But to return to our principal subject.  We shall now proceed to
consider the number of men employed in the concern: viz., fifty clerks,
seventy-one interpreters and clerks,  one thousand one hundred and twenty
canoe-men, and thirty-five guides.  Of these, five clerks, eighteen
guides, and three hundred and fifty canoe-men, were employed for the
summer season in going from Montreal to the Grande Portage, in canoes,
part of whom proceeded from thence to Rainy Lake, as will be hereafter
explained, and are called Pork-eaters, or Goers and Comers.  These were
hired in Canada or Montreal, and were absent from the 1st of May till
the latter end of September.  For this trip the guides had from eight
hundred to a thousand livres, and, a suitable equipment; the foreman and
steersman from four to six hundred livres; the middle-men from two
hundred and fifty to three hundred and fifty livres, with an equipment
of one blanket, one shirt, and one pair of trowsers; and were maintained
during that period at the expense of their employers.  Independent of
their wages, they were allowed to traffic, and many of them earned to
the amount of their wages.  About one-third of these went to winter, and
had more than double the above wages and equipment.  All the winterers
were hired by the year, and sometimes for three years; and of the clerks
many were apprentices, who were generally engaged for five or seven
years, for which they had only one hundred pounds, provision and
clothing.  Such of them who could not  be provided for as partners, at
the expiration of this time, were allowed from one hundred pounds to
three hundred pounds per annum, with all necessaries, till provision was
made for them.  Those who acted in the two-fold capacity of clerk and
interpreter, or were so denominated, had no other expectation than the
payment of wages to the amount of from one thousand to four thousand
livres per annum, with clothing and provisions.  The guides, who are a
very useful set of men, acted also in the additional capacity of
interpreters, and had a stated quantity of goods, considered as
sufficient for their wants, their wages being from one to three thousand
livres.  The canoe-men are of two descriptions, foremen and steersmen,
and middlemen.  The two first were allowed annually one thousand two
hundred, and the latter eight hundred, livres each.  The first class had
what is called an equipment, consisting of two blankets, two shirts, two
pair of trowsers, two handkerchiefs, fourteen pounds of carrot tobacco,
and some trifling articles.  The latter had ten pounds of tobacco, and
all the other articles: those are called North Men, or Winterers; and to
the last class of people were attached upwards of seven hundred Indian
women and children, victualled at the expence of the company.</p>

<p>The first class of people are hired in  Montreal five months before they
set out, and receive their equipments, and one-third of their wages in
advance; and an adequate idea of the labour they undergo, may be formed
from the following account of the country through which they pass, and
their manner of proceeding.</p>

<p>The necessary number of canoes being purchased, at about three hundred
livres each, the goods formed into packages, and the lakes and rivers
free of ice, which they usually are in the beginning of May, they are
then despatched from La Chine, eight miles above Montreal, with eight or
ten men in each canoe, and their baggage; and sixty-five packages of
goods, six hundred weight of biscuit, two hundred weight of pork, three
bushels of pease, for the men's provision; two oil-cloths to cover the
goods, a sail, etc., an axe, a towing-line, a kettle, and a sponge to
bail out the water, with a quantity of gum, bark, and watape, to repair
the vessel.  An European on seeing one of these slender vessels thus
laden, heaped up, and sunk with her gunwale within six inches of the
water, would think his fate inevitable in such a boat, when he reflected
on the nature of her voyage; but the Canadians are so expert that few
accidents happen.</p>

<p>Leaving La Chine, they proceed to St. Ann's, within two miles of the
Western  extremity
of the island of Montreal, the lake of the two
mountains being in sight, which may be termed the commencement of the
Utawas river.  At the rapid of St. Ann they are obliged to take out
part, if not the whole of their lading.  It is from this spot that the
Canadians consider they take their departure, as it possesses the last
church on the island, which is dedicated to the tutelar saint of
voyages.</p>

<p>The lake of the two mountains is about twenty miles long, but not
more than three wide, and surrounded by cultivated fields, except the
Seignory belonging to the clergy, though nominally in possession of the
two tribes of Iroquois and Algonquins, whose village is situated on a
delightful point of land under the hills, which, by the title of
mountains, give a name to the lake.  Near the extremity of the point
their church is built, which divides the village in two parts, forming a
regular angle along the water side.  On the East is the station of the
Algonquins, and on the West, one of the Iroquois, consisting in all of
about five hundred warriors.  Each party has its missionary, and divine
worship is performed according to the rites of the Roman Catholic
religion, in their respective languages in the same church: and so
assiduous have their pastors been, that these people have been
instructed in
reading  and
writing in their own language, and are better instructed than the
Canadian inhabitants of the country of the lower ranks: but
notwithstanding these advantages, and though the establishment is nearly
coeval with the colonization of the country, they do not advance towards
a state of civilization, but retain their ancient habits, language, and
customs, and are becoming every day more depraved, indigent, and
insignificant.  The country around them, though very capable of
cultivation, presents only a few miserable patches of ground, sown by
the women with maize and vegetables.  During the winter season, they
leave their habitations, and pious pastors, to follow the chase,
according to the custom of their forefathers.  Such is, indeed, the
state of all the villages near the cultivated parts of Canada.  But we
shall now leave them to proceed on our voyage.</p>

<p>At the end of the lake the water contracts into the Utawas river, which,
after a course of fifteen miles, is interrupted by a succession of
rapids and cascades for upwards of ten miles, at the foot of which the
Canadian Seignories terminate; and all above them were waste land, till
the conclusion of the American war, when they were surveyed by order of
government, and granted to the officers and men of the eighty-fourth
regiment, when reduced; but principally to the former,  and consequently
little inhabited, though very capable of cultivation.</p>

<p>The voyagers are frequently obliged to unload their canoes, and carry
the goods upon their backs, or rather suspended in slings from their
heads.  Each man's ordinary load is two packages, though some carry
three.  Here the canoe is towed by a strong line.  There are some places
where the ground will not admit of their carrying the whole; they then
make two trips, that is, leave half their lading, and go and land it at
the distance required; and then return for that which was left.  In this
distance are three carrying-places, the length of which depends in a
great measure upon the state of the water, whether higher or lower; from
the last of these the river is about a mile and a half wide, and has a
regular current for about sixty miles, when it ends at the first Portage
de Chaudiere, where the body of water falls twenty-five feet, over
cragged, excavated rocks, in a most wild, romantic manner.  At a small
distance below, is the river Rideau on the left, falling over a
perpendicular rock, near forty feet high, in one sheet, assuming the
appearance of a curtain; and from which circumstance it derives its
name.  To this extent the lands have been surveyed, as before observed,
and are very fit for culture.  Many loyalists are settled upon the river
 Rideau, and have,
I am told, thriving plantations.  Some American
families preferring the British territory, have also established
themselves along a river on the opposite side, where the soil is
excellent.  Nor do I think the period is far distant, when the lands
will become settled from this vicinity to Montreal.</p>

<p>Over this portage, which is six hundred and forty-three paces long,
the canoe and all the lading is carried.  The rock is so steep and
difficult of access, that it requires twelve men to take the canoe out
of the water: it is then carried by six men, two at each end on the same
side, and two under the opposite gunwale in the middle.  From hence to
the next is but a short distance, in which they make two trips to the
second Portage de Chaudiere, which is seven hundred paces, to carry the
loading alone.  From hence to the next and last Chaudiere, or Portage
des Chenes, is about six miles, with a very strong current, where the
goods are carried seven hundred and forty paces; the canoe being towed
up by the line, when the water is not very high.  We now enter Lac des
Chaudieres, which is computed to be thirty miles in length.  Though it
is called a lake, there is a strong draught downwards, and its breadth
is from two to four miles.  At the end of this is the Portage des Chats,
over  which the
canoe and lading are carried two hundred and seventy-four paces; and
very difficult it is for the former.  The river is here barred by a
ridge of black rock, rising in pinnacles and covered with wood, which,
from the small quantity of soil that nourishes it, is low and stinted.
The river finds its way over and through these rocks, in numerous
channels, falling fifteen feet and upwards.  From hence two trips are
made through a serpentine channel, formed by the rocks, for several
miles, when the current slackens, and is accordingly called the Lac des
Chats.  To the channels of the grand Calumet, which are computed to be
at the distance of eighteen miles, the current recovers its strength,
and proceeds to the Portage Dufort, which is two hundred and forty-five
paces long; over which the canoe and baggage are transported.  From
hence the current becomes more rapid, and requires two trips to the
Decharge des Sables,<a name="hl3" href="#hr3">[3]</a> where the goods
are carried one hundred and thirty-five paces, and the canoe towed.
Then follows the Mountain Portage, where the canoe and lading are also
carried three hundred and eighty-five paces; then to the Decharge
of  the Derige,
where the goods are carried two hundred and fifty paces; and thence to
the grand Calumet.  This is the longest carrying-place in this river,
and is about two thousand and thirty-five paces.  It is a high hill or
mountain.  From the upper part of this Portage the current is steady,
and is only a branch of the Utawas river, which joins the main channel,
that keeps a more Southern course, at the distance of twelve computed
leagues.  Six leagues further it forms Lake Coulonge, which is about
four leagues in length; from thence it proceeds through the channels of
the Allumettes to the decharge, where part of the lading is taken out,
and carried three hundred and forty-two paces.  Then succeeds the
Portage des Allumettes, which is but twenty-five paces, over a rock
difficult of access, and at a very short distance from Decharge.  From
Portage de Chenes to this spot, is a fine deer-hunting country, and the
land in many places very fit for cultivation.  From hence the river
spreads wide, and is full of islands, with some current for seven
leagues, to the beginning of <i>Riviere Creuse</i>, or Deep River, which
runs in the form of a canal, about a mile and a half wide, for about
thirty-six miles; bounded upon the North by very high rocks, with low
land on the South, and sandy; it is intercepted again by falls and
cataracts, so that
 the Portages
of the two Joachins almost join.  The first is nine hundred and
twenty-six paces, the next seven hundred and twenty, and both very bad
roads.  From hence is a steady current of nine miles to the river du
Moine, where there has generally been a trading house; the stream then
becomes strong for four leagues, when a rapid succeeds, which requires
two trips.  A little way onward is the Decharge, and close to it, the
Portage of the Roche Capitaine, seven hundred and ninety-seven paces in
length.  From hence two trips are made through a narrow channel of the
Roche Capitaine, made by an island four miles in length.  A strong
current now succeeds, for about six leagues to the Portage of the two
rivers, which is about eight hundred and twenty paces; from thence it is
three leagues to the Decharge of the Trou, which is three hundred paces.
Near adjoining is the rapid of Levellier; from whence, including the
rapids of Matawoen, where there is no carrying-place, it is about
thirty-six miles to the forks of the same name; in latitude
46. 45. North, and longitude 78. 45. West, and is at the computed
distance of four hundred miles from Montreal.  At this place the Petite
Riviere falls into the Utawas.  The latter river comes from a
North-Westerly direction, forming several lakes in its course.  The
principal of
them  is Lake
Temescamang, where there has always been a trading post, which may be
said to continue, by a succession of rivers and lakes, upwards of fifty
leagues from the Forks, passing near the waters of the Lake Abbitiby, in
latitude 48½, which is received by the Moose River, that empties itself
into James Bay.</p>

<p>The Petite Riviere takes a South-West direction, is full of rapids and
cataracts to its source, and is not more than fifteen leagues in length,
in the course of which are the following interruptions—The Portage of
Plein Champ, three hundred and nineteen paces; the Decharge of the Rose,
one hundred and forty-five paces; the Decharge of Campion, one hundred
and eighty-four paces; the Portage of the Grosse Roche, one hundred and
fifty paces; the Portage of Paresseux, four hundred and two paces; the
Portage of Prairie, two hundred and eighty-seven paces; the Portage of
La Cave, one hundred paces; Portage of Talon, two hundred and
seventy-five paces; which, for its length, is the worst on the
communication; Portage Pin de Musique, four hundred and fifty-six paces;
next to this, is mauvais de Musique, where many men have been crushed to
death by the canoes, and others have received irrecoverable injuries.
The last in this river is the Turtle Portage, eighty-three paces, on
entering the lake of that name, where, indeed, the river  may be said to
take its source.  At the first vase from whence to the great river, the
country has the appearance of having been over-run by fire, and
consists, in general, of huge rocky hills.  The distance of this portage
which is the height of land, between the waters of the St. Laurence and
the Utawas, is one thousand five hundred and thirteen paces to a small
canal in a plain, that is just sufficient to carry the loaded canoe
about one mile to the next vase, which is seven hundred and twenty-five
paces.  It would be twice this distance, but the narrow creek is dammed
in the beaver fashion, to float the canoes to this barrier, through
which they pass, when the river is just sufficient to bear them through
a swamp of two miles to the last vase, of one thousand and twenty-four
paces in length.  Though the river is increased in this part, some care
is necessary to avoid rocks and stumps of trees.  In about six miles is
the lake Nepisingui, which is computed to be twelve leagues long, though
the route of the canoes is something more: it is about fifteen miles
wide in the widest part, and bound with rocks.  Its inhabitants consist
of the remainder of a numerous converted tribe, called Nepisinguis of
the Algonquin nation.  Out of it flows the Riviere des François, over
rocks of a considerable height.  In a bay to the East of this, the road
leads over  the
Portage of the Chaudiere des François, five hundred and
forty-four paces, to still water.  It must have acquired the name of
Kettle, from a great number of holes in the solid rock of a cylindrical
form, and not unlike that culinary utensil.  They are observable in many
parts along strong bodies of water, and where, at certain seasons, and
distinct periods, it is well known the water inundates; at the bottom of
them are generally found a number of small stones and pebbles.  This
circumstance justifies the conclusion, that at some former period these
rocks formed the bed of a branch of the discharge of this lake, although
some of them are upwards of ten feet above the present level of the
water at its greatest height.  They are, indeed, to be seen along every
great river throughout this wide extended country.  The French river is
very irregular, both as to its breadth and form, and is so interspersed
with islands, that in the whole course of it the banks are seldom
visible.  Of its various channels, that which is generally followed by
the canoes is obstructed by the following Portages, viz., des Pins,
fifty-two paces; Feausille, thirty-six paces; Parisienne, one hundred
paces; Recolet, forty-five paces; and the Petite Feausille, twenty-five
paces.  In several parts there are guts or channels, where the water
flows with great velocity,  which are not more than twice the breadth of
a canoe.  The distance to Lake Huron is estimated at twenty-five
leagues, which this river enters in the latitude 45. 53. North, that is,
at the point of land three or four miles within the lake.  There is
hardly a foot of soil to be seen from one end of the French river to the
other, its banks consisting of hills of entire rock.  The coast of the
lake is the same, but lower, backed at some distance by high lands.  The
course runs through numerous islands to the North of West to the river
Tessalon, computed to be about fifty leagues from the French river, and
which I found to be in latitude 46. 12. 21. North; and from thence
crossing, from island to island, the arm of the lake that receives the
water of Lake Superior (which continues the same course), the route
changes to the South of West ten leagues to the Detour, passing the end
of the island of St. Joseph, within six miles of the former place.  On
that island there has been a military establishment since the upper
posts were given up to the Americans in the year 1794; and is the
Westernmost military position which we have in this country.  It is a
place of no trade, and the greater part, if not the whole of the Indians
come here for no other purpose but to receive the presents which our
government annually allows them.  They are from the  American territory
(except about thirty families, who are the inhabitants of the lake from
the French river, and of the Algonquin nation) and trade in their
peltries, as they used formerly to do at Michilimakinac, but principally
with British subjects.  The Americans pay them very little attention,
and tell them that they keep possession of their country by right of
conquest: that, as their brothers, they will be friends with them while
they deserve it; and that their traders will bring them every kind of
goods they require, which they may procure by their industry.</p>

<p>Our commanders treat them in a very different manner, and, under the
character of the representative of their father (which parental title
the natives give to his present Majesty, the common father of all his
people) present them with such things as the actual state of their
stores will allow.</p>

<p>How far this conduct, if continued, may, at a future exigency, keep
these people in our interest, if they are even worthy of it, is not an
object of my present consideration: at the same time, I cannot avoid
expressing my perfect conviction, that it would not be of the least
advantage to our present or future commerce in that country, or to the
people themselves; as it only tends to keep many of them in a state of
idleness about our military establishments.  The ammunition which
 they
receive is employed to kill game, in order to procure rum in return,
though their families may be in a starving condition: hence it is, that,
in consequence of slothful and dissolute lives, their numbers are in a
very perceptible state of diminution.</p>

<p>From the Detour to the island of Michilimakinac, at the conference of
the Lakes Huron and Michigan, in latitude 45. 54. North is about forty
miles.  To keep the direct course to Lake Superior, the North shore from
the river Tessalon should be followed; crossing to the North-West end of
St. Joseph, and passing between it and the adjacent islands, which makes
a distance of fifty miles to the fall of St. Mary, at the foot of which,
upon the South shore, there is a village, formerly a place of great
resort for the inhabitants of Lake Superior, and consequently of
considerable trade: it is now, however, dwindled to nothing, and reduced
to about thirty families, of the Algonquin, nation, who are one half of
the year starving, and the other half intoxicated, and ten or twelve
Canadians, who have been in the Indian country from an early period of
life, and intermarried with the natives, who have brought them families.
Their inducements to settle there, was the great quantity of white fish
that are to be taken in and about the falls, with very little trouble,
 particularly in the
autumn, when that fish leave the lakes, and comes to
the running and shallow waters to spawn.  These, when salt can be
procured, are pickled just as the frost sets in, and prove very good
food with potatoes, which they have of late cultivated with success.
The natives live chiefly on this fish, which they hang up by the tails,
and preserve throughout the winter, or at least as long as they last;
for whatever quantity they may have taken, it is never known that their
economy is such as to make them last through the winter, which renders
their situation very distressing; for if they had activity sufficient to
pursue the labours of the chase, the woods are become so barren of game
as to afford them no great prospect of relief.  In the spring of the
year, they and the other inhabitants make a quantity of sugar from the
maple tree, which they exchange with the traders for necessary articles,
or carry it to Michilimakinac, where they expect a better price.  One of
these traders was agent for the North-West Company, receiving, storing,
and forwarding such articles as come by the way of the lakes upon their
vessels: for it is to be observed, that a quantity of their goods are
sent by that route from Montreal in boats to Kingston, at the entrance
of Lake Ontario, and from thence in vessels to Niagara, then over land
ten miles to a water 
communication by boats, to Lake Erie, where they are again
received into vessels, and carried over that lake up the river
Detroit, through the lake and river Sinclair to Lake Huron, and from
thence to the Falls of St. Mary's, when they are again landed and
carried for a mile above the falls, and shipped over Lake Superior to
the Grande Portage.  This is found to be a less expensive method than by
canoes, but attended with more risk, and requiring more time, than one
short season of this country will admit; for the goods are always sent
from Montreal the preceding fall; and besides, the company get their
provisions from Detroit, as flour and Indian corn; as also considerable
supplies from Michilimakinac of maple sugar, tallow, gum, etc., etc.</p>

<p>For the purpose of conveying all these things, they have two vessels
upon the Lakes Erie and Huron, and one on Lake Superior, of from fifty
to seventy tons burden.  This being, therefore, the depot for
transports, the Montreal canoes, on their arrival, were forwarded over
Lake Superior, with only five men in each; the others were sent to
Michilimakinac for additional canoes, which were required to prosecute
the trade, and then taking a lading there, or at St. Mary's, and follow
the others.  At length they all arrive at the Grande Portage which is
one hundred 
and sixty leagues from St. Mary's, coastways, and situated
on a pleasant bay on the North side of the lake, in latitude 48. North,
and longitude 90. West from Greenwich, where the compass has not above
five degrees East variation.</p>

<p>At the entrance of the bay is an island which screens the harbour from
every wind except the South.  The shallowness of the water, however,
renders it necessary for the vessel to anchor near a mile from the
shore, where there is not more than fourteen feet water.  This lake
justifies the name that has been given to it; the Falls of St. Mary,
which is its Northern extremity, being in latitude 46. 31. North, and in
longitude 84.  West, where there is no variation of the compass
whatever, while its Southern extremity, at the river St. Louis, is in
latitude 46. 45. North, and longitude 92. 10. West: its greatest
breadth is one hundred and twenty miles, and its circumference,
including its various bays, is not less than one thousand two hundred
miles.  Along its North shore is the safest navigation, as it is a
continued mountainous embankment of rock, from three hundred to one
thousand five hundred feet in height.  There are numerous coves and
sandy bays to land, which are frequently sheltered by islands from the
swell of the lake.  This is particularly the case at the distance of one
 hundred
miles to the Eastward of the Grande Portage, and is called the Pays Plat.
</p>

<p>This seems to have been caused by some convulsion of nature, for many of
the islands display a composition of lava, intermixed with round stones
of the size of a pigeon's egg.  The surrounding rock is generally hard,
and of a dark blue-grey, though it frequently has the appearance of iron
and copper.  The South side of the lake, from Point Shagoimigo East, is
almost a continual straight line of sandy beach, interspersed with rocky
precipices of lime-stones, sometimes rising to a hundred feet in height,
without a bay.  The embankments from that point Westward are, in
general, of strong clay, mixed with stones, which renders the navigation
irksome and dangerous.  On the same side, at the river Tonnagan, is
found a quantity of virgin copper.  The Americans, soon after they got
possession of that country, sent an engineer thither; and I should not
be surprised to hear of their employing people to work the mine.
Indeed, it might be well worthy the attention of the British subjects to
work the mines on the North coast, though they are not supposed to be so
rich as those on the South.</p>

<p>Lake Superior is the largest and most magnificent body of fresh water in
the world: it is clear and pellucid, of great  depth, and abounding in a
great variety of fish, which are the most excellent of their kind.
There are trouts of three kinds, weighing from five to fifty pounds,
sturgeon, pickerel, pike, red and white carp, black bass, herrings,
etc., etc., and the last, and best of all, the Ticamang, or white fish,
which weighs from four to sixteen pounds, and is of a superior quality
in these waters.</p>

<p>This lake may be denominated the grand reservoir of the River
St. Laurence, as no considerable rivers discharge themselves into it.
The principal ones are, the St. Louis, the Nipigon, the Pic, and the
Michipicoten.  Indeed, the extent of country from which any of them
flow, or take their course, in any direction, cannot admit of it, in
consequence of the ridge of land that separates them from the rivers
that empty themselves into Hudson's-Bay, the gulf of Mexico, and the
waters that fall in Lake Michigan, which afterward become a part of the
St. Laurence.</p>

<p>This vast collection of water is often covered with fog, particularly
when the wind is from the East, which, driving against the high barren
rocks on the North and West shore, dissolves in torrents of rain.  It is
very generally said, that the storms on this lake are denoted by a swell
on the preceding day; but this circumstance did not appear from my
observation to be a regular  phenomenon, as the swells more regularly
subsided without any subsequent wind.</p>

<p>Along the surrounding rocks of this immense lake, evident marks appear
of the decrease of its water, by the lines observable along them.  The
space, however, between the highest and the lowest, is not so great as
in the smaller lakes, as it does not amount to more than six feet, the
former being very faint.</p>

<p>The inhabitants that are found along the coast of this water, are all of
the Algonquin nation, the whole of which do not exceed 150 families.<a name="hl4" href="#hr4">[4]</a></p>

<p>These people live chiefly on fish; indeed, from what has been said of
the country, it cannot be expected to abound in animals, as it is
totally destitute of that shelter, which is so necessary to them.  The
rocks appear to have been over-run by fire, and the stinted timber which
once grew there, is frequently seen lying along the surface of them: but
it is not easy to be reconciled, that anything  should grow where there
is so little appearance of soil.  Between the fallen trees there are
briars, with hurtleberry and gooseberry bushes, raspberries, etc., which
invite the bears in greater or lesser numbers, as they are a favourite
food of that animal: beyond these rocky banks are found a few moose and
fallow deer.  The waters alone are abundantly inhabited.</p>

<p>A very curious phenomenon was observed some years ago at the Grande
Portage, for which no obvious cause could be assigned.  The water
withdrew with great precipitation, leaving the ground dry that had never
before been visible, the fall being equal to four perpendicular feet,
and rushing back with great velocity above the common mark.  It
continued thus falling and rising for several hours, gradually
decreasing till it stopped at its usual height.  There is frequently an
irregular influx and deflux, which does not exceed ten inches, and is
attributed to the wind.</p>

<p>The bottom of the bay, which forms an amphitheatre, is cleared of wood
and inclosed; and on the left corner of it, beneath an hill, three or
four hundred feet in height, and crowned by others of a still greater
altitude, is the fort, picketed in with cedar pallisadoes, and inclosing
houses built with wood and covered with shingles.  They are calculated
for every convenience of trade, as well  as to accommodate the
proprietors and clerks during their short residence there.  The north
men live under tents: but the more frugal pork-eater lodges beneath his
canoe.  The soil immediately bordering on the lake has not proved very
propitious, as nothing but potatoes have been found to answer the
trouble of cultivation.  This circumstance is probably owing to the cold
damp fogs of the lake, and the moisture of the ground from the springs
that issue from beneath the hills.  There are meadows in the vicinity
that yield abundance of hay for the cattle; but, as to agriculture, it
has not hitherto been an object of serious consideration.</p>

<p>I shall now leave these geographical notices, to give some further
account of the people from Montreal.—When they are arrived at the
Grande Portage, which is near nine miles over, each of them has to carry
eight packages of such goods and provisions as are necessary for the
interior country.  This is a labour which cattle cannot conveniently
perform in summer, as both horses and oxen were tried by the company
without success.  They are only useful for light, bulky articles; or for
transporting upon sledges, during the winter, whatever goods may remain
there, especially provision, of which it is usual to have a year's stock
on hand.</p>


<p>Having finished this toilsome part of their duty, if more goods are
necessary to be transported, they are allowed a Spanish dollar for each
package: and so inured are they to this kind of labour, that I have
known some of them set off with two packages of ninety pounds each, and
return with two others of the same weight, in the course of six hours,
being a distance of eighteen miles over hills and mountains.  This
necessary part of the business being over, if the season be early they
have some respite, but this depends upon the time the North men begin to
arrive from their winter quarters, which they commonly do early in July.
At this period, it is necessary to select from the pork-eaters, a number
of men, among whom are the recruits, or winterers, sufficient to man the
North canoes necessary to carry, to the river of the rainy lake, the
goods and provision requisite for the Athabasca country; as the people
of that country (owing to the shortness of the season and length of the
road, can come no further), are equipped there, and exchange ladings
with the people of whom we are speaking, and both return from whence
they came.  This voyage is performed in the course of a month, and they
are allowed proportionable wages for their services.</p>

<p>The North men being arrived at the Grande Portage, are regaled with
bread, pork, 
butter, liquor, and tobacco, and such as have not entered
into agreements during the winter, which is customary, are contracted
with, to return and perform the voyage for one, two, or three years;
their accounts are also settled, and such as choose to send any of their
earnings to Canada, receive drafts to transmit to their relations or
friends; and as soon as they can be got ready, which requires no more
than a fortnight, they are again despatched to their respective
departments.  It is, indeed, very creditable to them as servants, that
though they are sometimes assembled to the number of twelve hundred men,
indulging themselves in the free use of liquor, and quarrelling with
each other, they always show the greatest respect to their employers,
who are comparatively but few in number, and beyond the aid of any legal
power to enforce due obedience.  In short, a degree of subordination can
only be maintained by the good opinion these men entertain of their
employers, which has been uniformly the case, since the trade has been
formed and conducted on a regular system.</p>

<p>The people being despatched to their respective winter-quarters, the
agents from Montreal, assisted by their clerks, prepare to return there,
by getting the furs across the portage, and re-making them into packages
of one hundred pounds weight each, to send  them to Montreal; where they
commonly arrive in the month of September.</p>

<p>The mode of living at the Grande Portage is as follows: The proprietors,
clerks, guides, and interpreters, mess together, to the number of
sometimes an hundred, at several tables, in one large hall, the
provision consisting of bread, salt pork, beef, hams, fish, and venison,
butter, peas, Indian corn, potatoes, tea, spirits, wine, etc., and
plenty of milk, for which purpose several milch cows are constantly
kept.  The mechanics have rations of such provision, but the canoe-men,
both from the North and Montreal, have no other allowance here, or in
the voyage, than Indian corn and melted fat.  The corn for this purpose
is prepared before it leaves Detroit, by boiling it in a strong alkali,
which takes off the outer husk: it is then well washed, and carefully
dried upon stages, when it is fit for use.  One quart of this is boiled
for two hours, over a moderate fire, in a gallon of water; to which,
when it has boiled a small time, are added two ounces of melted suet;
this causes the corn to split, and in the time mentioned makes a pretty
thick pudding.  If to this is added a little salt, (but not before it is
boiled, as it would interrupt the operation) it makes a wholesome,
palatable food, and easy of digestion.  This quantity is fully
sufficient for a man's subsistence during twenty-four hours; though it
is not sufficiently heartening to sustain the strength necessary for a
state of active labour.  The Americans call this dish hominy.<a name="hl5" href="#hr5">[5]</a></p>

<p>The trade from the Grande Portage is, in some particulars, carried on in
a different manner with that from Montreal.  The canoes used in the
latter transport are now too large for the former, and some of about
half the size are procured from the natives, and are navigated by four,
five, or six men, according to the distance which they have to go.  They
carry a lading of about thirty-five packages, on an average; of these
twenty-three are for the purpose of trade, and the rest are employed for
provisions, stores, and baggage.  In each of these canoes are a foreman
and steersman; the one to be always on the look-out, and direct the
passage of the vessel, and the other to attend the helm.  They also
carry her, whenever that office is necessary.  The foreman has the
command, and the middle-men obey both; the latter earn only two-thirds
of the wages which are paid the two former. Independent of these, a
conductor or pilot is appointed to every  four or six of these canoes,
whom they are all obliged to obey; and is, or at least is intended to
be, a person of superior experience, for which he is proportionably
paid.</p>

<p>In these canoes, thus loaded, they embark at the North side of the
portage, on the river Au Tourt, which is very inconsiderable; and after
about two miles of a Westerly course, is obstructed by the Partridge
Portage, six hundred paces long.  In the spring this makes a
considerable fall, when the water is high, over a perpendicular rock of
one hundred and twenty feet.  From, thence the river continues to be
shallow, and requires great care to prevent the bottom of the canoe from
being injured by sharp rocks, for a distance of three miles and an half
to the Priarie, or Meadow, when half the lading is taken out, and
carried by part of the crew, while two of them are conducting the canoe
among the rocks, with the remainder, to the Carreboeuf Portage, three
miles and a half more, when they unload, and come back two miles, and
embark what was left for the other hands to carry, which they also land
with the former; all of which is carried six hundred and eighty paces,
and the canoe led up against the rapid.  From hence the water is better
calculated to carry canoes, and leads by a winding course to the North
of West 
three miles to the Outard Portage, over which the canoe, and
every thing in her, is carried for two thousand four hundred paces.  At
the further end is a very high hill to descend, over which hangs a rock
upwards of seven hundred feet high.  Then succeeds the Outard Lake,
about six miles long, lying in a North-West course, and about two miles
wide in the broadest place.</p>

<p>After passing a very small rivulet, they come to the Elk Portage,
over which the canoe and lading are again carried one thousand one
hundred and twenty paces; when they enter the lake of the same name,
which is an handsome piece of water, running North-West about four
miles, and not more than one mile and an half wide.<a name="hl6" href="#hr6">[6]</a> They then land at the Portage de Cerise, over which,
and in the face of a considerable hill, the canoe and cargo are again
transported for one thousand and fifty paces.  This is only separated
from the second Portage de Cerise, by a mud-pond (where there is plenty
of water lilies), of a quarter of a mile in length; and this is again
separated by a similar pond, from the last Portage de Cerise, which is
four hundred and ten paces.  Here the same operation is to be performed
for three hundred and eighty paces.  They next enter on the
Mountain 
Lake, running North-West by West six miles long, and about two miles in
its greatest breadth.  In the centre of this lake, and to the right is
the Old Road, by which I never passed, but an adequate notion may be
formed of it from the road I am going to describe, and which is
universally preferred.  This is first, the small new portage over which
everything is carried for six hundred and twenty-six paces, over hills
and gullies; the whole is then embarked on a narrow line of water, that
meanders South-West about two miles and an half.  It is necessary to
unload here, for the length of the canoe, and then proceed West half a
mile, to the new Grande Portage, which is three thousand one hundred
paces in length, and over very rough ground, which requires the utmost
exertions of the men, and frequently lames them: from hence they
approach the Rose Lake, the portage of that name being opposite to the
junction of the road from the Mountain Lake.  They then embark on the
Rose Lake, about one mile from the East end of it, and steer West by
South, in an oblique course, across it two miles, then North-West
passing the Petite Peche to the Marten Portage three miles.  In this
part of the lake the bottom is mud and slime, with about three or four
feet of water over it; and here I frequently struck a canoe pole of
twelve feet
long,  without
meeting any other obstruction than if the whole were water: it has,
however, a peculiar suction or attractive power, so that it is difficult
to paddle a canoe over it.  There is a small space along the South
shore, where the water is deep, and this effect is not felt.  In
proportion to the distance from this part, the suction becomes more
powerful: I have, indeed, been told that loaded canoes have been in
danger of being swallowed up, and have only owed their preservation to
other canoes, which were lighter.  I have, myself, found it very
difficult to get away from this attractive power, with six men, and
great exertion, though we did not appear to be in any danger of
sinking.</p>

<p>Over against this is a very high, rocky ridge, on the South side, called
Marten Portage, which is but twenty paces long, and separated from the
Perche Portage, which is four hundred and eighty paces, by a mud pond,
covered with white lilies.  From hence the course is on the lake of the
same name, West-South-West three miles to the height of land, where the
waters of the Dove or Pigeon River terminate, and which is one of the
sources of the great St. Laurence in this direction.  Having carried the
canoe and lading over it, six hundred and seventy-nine paces, they
embark on the lake of Hauteur de Terre, which is in the shape of an
 horseshoe.<a name="hl7" href="#hr7">[7]</a> It is entered near the curve, and left at
the extremity of the Western limb, through a very shallow channel, where the
canoe passes half loaded for thirty paces with the current, which conducts
these waters till they discharge themselves, through the succeeding lakes and
rivers, and disembogues itself, by the river Nelson, into Hudson's Bay.
The first of these is Lac de pierres a fusil, running West-South-West
seven miles long, and two wide, and making an angle at North-West one
mile more, becomes a river for half a mile, tumbling over a rock, and
forming a fall and portage, called the Escalier, of fifty-five paces;
but from hence it is neither lake or river, but possesses the character
of both, and runs between large rocks, which cause a current or rapid
for about two miles and an half, West-North-West, to the portage of the
Cheval du Bois. Here the canoe and contents are carried three hundred
and eighty paces, between rocks; and within a quarter of a mile is the
Portage des Gros Pins, which is six hundred and forty paces over a high
ridge. The opposite side of it  is washed by a small lake three mile
round; and the course is through the East end or side of it, three
quarters of a mile North-East, where there is a rapid.  An irregular
meandering channel, between rocky banks, then succeeds, for seven miles
and an half, to the Maraboeuf Lake, which extends North four miles, and
is three-quarters of a mile wide, terminating by a rapid and decharge of
one hundred and eighty paces, the rock of Saginaga being in sight, which
causes a fall of about seven feet, and a portage of fifty-five paces.</p>

<p>Lake Saginaga takes its name from its numerous islands.  Its greatest
length from East to West is about fourteen miles, with very irregular
inlets, is nowhere more than three miles wide, and terminates at the
small portage of Le Roche, of forty-three paces.  From thence is a
rocky, stony passage of one mile, to Priarie Portage, which is very
improperly named, as there is no ground about it that answers to that
description, except a small spot at the embarking place at the West end:
to the East is an entire bog; and it is with great difficulty that the
lading can be landed upon stages, formed by driving piles into the mud,
and spreading branches of trees over them.  The portage rises on a stony
ridge, over which the canoe and cargo must be carried for six hundred
and eleven 
paces.  This is succeeded by an embarkation on a small bay,
where the bottom is the same as has been described in the West end of
Rose Lake, and it is with great difficulty that a laden canoe is worked
over it, but it does not comprehend more than a distance of two hundred
yards.  From hence the progress continues through irregular channels,
bounded by rocks, in a Westerly course for about five miles, to the
little Portage des Couteaux, of one hundred and sixty-five paces, and
the Lac des Couteaux, running about South-West by West twelve miles, and
from a quarter to two miles wide.  A deep bay runs East three miles from
the West end, where it is discharged by a rapid river, and after running
two miles West, it again becomes still water.  In this river are two
carrying-places, the one fifteen, and the other one hundred and ninety
paces.  From this to the Portage des Carpes is one mile North-West,
leaving a narrow lake on the East that runs parallel with the Lac des
Couteaux, half its length, where there is a carrying-place, which is
used when the water in the river last mentioned is too low.  The Portage
des Carpes is three hundred and ninety paces, from whence the water
spreads irregularly between rocks, five miles North-West and South-East
to the Portage of Lac Bois Blanc, which is one hundred and eighty paces.
Then follows the lake of that name,  but I think improperly so called, as
the natives name it the Lac Passeau Minac Sagaigan, or lake of Dry
Berries.</p>

<p>Before the small-pox ravaged this country, and completed, what the
Nodowasis, in their warfare, had gone far to accomplish, the destruction
of its inhabitants, the population was very numerous: this was also a
favourite part, where they made their canoes, etc., the lake abounding
in fish, the country round it being plentifully supplied with various
kinds of game, and the rocky ridges, that form the boundaries of the
water, covered with a variety of berries.</p>

<p>When the French were in possession of this country, they had several
trading establishments on the islands and banks of this lake.  Since
that period, the few people remaining, who were of the Algonquin nation,
could hardly find subsistence; game having become so scarce, that they
depended principally for food upon fish and wild rice, which grows
spontaneously in these parts.</p>

<p>This lake is irregular in its form, and its utmost extent from East to
West is fifteen miles; a point of land, called Point au Pin, jutting
into it, divides it in two parts: it then makes a second angle at the
West end, to the lesser Portage de Bois Blanc, two hundred paces in
length.  This channel is not wide, and is intercepted by several rapids
in  the course of
a mile: it runs West-North West to the Portage des Pins, over which
the canoe and lading is again carried four hundred paces.  From hence
the channel is also intercepted by very dangerous rapids, for two
miles Westerly, to the point of Pointe du Bois, which is two
hundred and eighty paces.  Then succeeds the portage of La Croche,
one mile more, where the carrying-place is eighty paces, and is followed
by an embarkation on that lake, which takes its name from its figure.
It extends eighteen miles, in a meandering form, and in a westerly
direction; it is in general very narrow, and at about two-thirds of its
length becomes very contracted, with a strong current.</p>

<p>Within three miles of the last Portage is a remarkable rock, with a
smooth face, but split and cracked in different parts, which hang over
the water.  Into one of its horizontal chasms a great number of arrows
have been shot, which is said to have been done by a war party of the
Nadowasis or Sieux, who had done much mischief in this country, and left
these weapons as a warning to the Chebois or natives, that,
notwithstanding its lakes, rivers, and rocks, it was not inaccessible to
their enemies.</p>

<p>Lake Croche is terminated by the Portage de Rideau, four hundred paces
long, and derives its name from the appearance of the  water, falling
over a rock of upwards of thirty feet.  Several rapids succeed, with
intervals of still water, for about three miles to the Flacon portage,
which is very difficult, is four hundred paces long, and leads to the
Lake of La Croix, so named from its shape.  It runs about North-West
eighteen miles to the Beaver Dam, and then sinks into a deep bay nearly
East.  The course to the Portage is West by North for sixteen miles more
from the Beaver Dam, and into the East bay is a road which was
frequented by the French, and followed through lakes and rivers until
they came to Lake Superior by the river Caministiquia, thirty miles East
of the Grande Portage.</p>

<p>Portage la Croix is six hundred paces long: to the next portage is a
quarter of a mile, and its length is forty paces; the river winding four
miles to Vermillion Lake, which runs six or seven miles
North-North-West, and by a narrow strait communicates with Lake
Namaycan, which takes its name from a particular place at the foot of a
fall, where the natives spear sturgeon: Its course is about
North-North-West and South-South-East, with a bay running East, that
gives it the form of a triangle: its length is about sixteen miles to
the Nouvelle Portage.</p>

<p>The discharge of the lake is from a bay on the left, and the portage
one hundred
eighty  paces, to
which succeeds a very small river, from whence there is but a short
distance to the next Nouvelle Portage, three hundred and twenty paces
long.  It is then necessary to embark on a swamp, or overflowed country,
where wild rice grows in great abundance.  There is a channel or small
river in the centre of this swamp, which is kept with difficulty, and
runs South and North one mile and a half.  With deepening water, the
course continues North-North-West one mile to the Chaudiere Portage,
which is caused by the discharge of the waters running on the left of
the road from Lake Namaycan, which used to be the common route, but that
which I have described is the safest as well as shortest.  From hence
there is some current though the water is wide spread, and its course
about North by West three miles and an half to the Lac de la Pluie,
which lies nearly East and West; from thence about fifteen miles is a
narrow strait that divides the lake into two unequal parts, from whence
to its discharge is a distance of twenty-four miles.  There is a deep
bay running North-West on the right, that is not included, and is
remarkable for furnishing the natives with a kind of soft, red stone, of
which they make their pipes; it also affords an excellent fishery both
in the summer and winter; and from it is an easy, safe, and short road
to the Lac du Bois,  (which I shall mention presently) for the
Indians to pass in their small canoes, through a small lake and on a
small river, whose banks furnish abundance of wild rice.  The discharge
of this lake is called Lac de la Pluie River, at whose entrance there is
a rapid, below which is a fine bay, where there had been an extensive
picketed fort and building when possessed by the French: the site of it
is at present a beautiful meadow, surrounded with groves of oaks.  From
hence there is a strong current for two miles, where the water falls
over a rock twenty feet, and, from the consequent turbulence of the
water, the carrying-place, which is three hundred and twenty paces long,
derives the name of Chaudiere.  Two miles onward is the present trading
establishment, situated on an high bank on the North side of the river,
in 48. 37. North latitude.</p>

<p>Here the people from Montreal come to meet those who arrive from the
Athabasca country, as has been already described, and exchange lading
with them.  This is also the residence of the first chief, or Sachem, of
all the Algonquin tribes, inhabiting the different parts of this
country.  He is by distinction called Nectam, which implies personal
preeminence.  Here also the elders meet in council to treat of peace or
war.</p>

<p>This is one of the finest rivers in the  North-West, and runs a course
West and East one hundred and twenty computed miles; but in taking its
course and distance minutely I make it only eighty.  Its banks are
covered with a rich soil, particularly to the North, which, in many
parts, are clothed with fine open groves of oak, with the maple, the
pine, and the cedar.  The Southern bank is not so elevated, and displays
the maple, the white birch, and the cedar, with the spruce, the alder,
and various underwood.  Its waters abound in fish, particularly the
sturgeon, which the natives both spear and take with drag-nets.  But
notwithstanding the promise of this soil, the Indians do not attend to
its cultivation, though they are not ignorant of the common process, and
are fond of the Indian corn, when they can get it from us.</p>

<p>Though the soil at the fort is a stiff clay, there is a garden, which,
unassisted as it is by manure, or any particular attention, is tolerably
productive.</p>

<p>We now proceed to mention the Lac du Bois, into which this river
discharges itself in latitude 49. North, and was formerly famous for the
richness of its banks and waters, which abounded with whatever was
necessary to a savage life.  The French had several settlements in and
about it; but it might be almost concluded, that some fatal  circumstance
had destroyed the game, as war and the small-pox had diminished the
inhabitants, it having been very unproductive in animals since the
British subjects have been engaged in travelling through it; though it
now appears to be recovering its pristine state.  The few Indians who
inhabit it might live very comfortably, if they were not so immoderately
fond of spirituous liquors.</p>

<p>This lake is also rendered remarkable, in consequence of the Americans
having named it as the spot, from which a line of boundary, between them
and British America, was to run West, until it struck the Mississippi:
which, however, can never happen, as the North-West part of the Lac du
Bois is in latitude 49. 37. North, and longitude 94.31.  West, and the
Northernmost branch of the source of the Mississippi is in latitude
47. 38. North, and longitude 95. 6. West, ascertained by Mr. Thomson,
astronomer to the North-West Company, who was sent expressly for that
purpose in the spring of 1798.  He, in the same year, determined the
Northern bend of the Mississoury to be in latitude 47. 32. North, and
longitude 101. 25. West; and, according to the Indian accounts, it runs
to the south of West, so that if the Mississoury were even to be
considered as the Mississippi, no Western line could strike it.</p>

<p>It does not appear to me to be clearly  determined what course the Line
is to take, or from what part of Lake Superior it strikes through the
country to the Lac du Bois: were it to follow the principal waters to
their source, it ought to keep through Lake Superior to the River
St. Louis, and follow that river to its source; close to which is the
source of the waters falling into the river of Lac la Pluie, which is a
common route of the Indians to the Lac du Bois; the St. Louis passes
within a short distance of a branch of the Mississippi, where it becomes
navigable for canoes.  This will appear more evident from consulting the
map: and if the navigation of the Mississippi is considered as of any
consequence by this country, from that part of the globe, such is the
nearest way to get at it.</p>

<p>But to return to our narrative.  The Lac du Bois is, as far as I could
learn, nearly round, and the canoe course through the centre of it among
a cluster of islands, some of which are so extensive that they may be
taken for the mainland.  The reduced course would be nearly South and
North.  But following the navigating course, I make the distance
seventy-five miles, though in a direct line it would fall very short of
that length.  At about two-thirds of it there is a small carrying-place,
when the water is low.  The carrying-place out of the Lake is on the
 island and named
Portage du Rat, in latitude 49. 37. North, and longitude 94. 15. West;
it is about fifty paces long.  The lake discharges itself at both ends of
this island, and forms the River Winipic, which is a large body of water,
interspersed with numerous islands, causing various channels and interruptions
of portages and rapids.  In some parts it has the appearance of lakes, with
steady currents; I estimate its winding course to the Dalles eight miles; to
the Grand Decharge twenty-five miles and an half, which is a long
carrying-place for the goods; from thence to the little Decharge one
mile and an half; to the Terre Jaune Portage two miles and an half; then
to its galet seventy yards; two miles and three quarters to the Terre
Blanche, near which is a fall of from four to five feet; three miles and
an half to Portage de L'Isle, where there is a trading-post, and, about
eleven miles, on the north shore, a trading establishment, which is the
road in boats, to Albany River, and from thence to Hudson's-Bay.  There
is also a communication with Lake Superior, through what is called the
Nipigan country, which enters that Lake about thirty-five leagues East
of the Grande Portage.  In short, the country is so broken by lakes and
rivers, that people may find their way in canoes in any direction they
please.  It is now four miles <span class="pagenum">{<a name="pxcviii">
</a>xcviii}</span> to Portage de L'Isle, which is but short,
though several canoes have been lost in attempting to run the rapid.
From thence it is twenty-six miles to Jacob's Falls, which are about
fifteen feet high; and six miles and an half to the woody point; forty
yards from which is another Portage.  They both form an high fall, but
not perpendicular.  From thence to another galet, or rock Portage, is
about two miles, which is one continual rapid and cascade; and about two
miles further is the Chute a l'Esclave, which is upward of thirty feet.
The Portage is long, through a point covered with wood: it is six miles
and an half more to the barrier, and ten miles to the Grand Rapid.  From
thence, on the North side, is a safe road, when the waters are high,
through small rivers and lakes, to the Lake du Bonnet, called the
Pinnawas, from the man who discovered it: to the White River, so called
from its being, for a considerable length, a succession of falls and
cataracts, is twelve miles.  Here are seven portages, in so short a
space, that the whole of them are discernible at the same moment.  From
this to Lake du Bonnet is fifteen miles more, and four miles across it
to the rapid.  Here the Pinnawas Road joins, and from thence it is two
miles to the Galet du Lac du Bonnet; from this to the Galet du Bonnet
one mile and an half; thence to the Portage  of the same name is three
miles.  This portage is near half a league in length, and derives its
name from the custom the Indians have of crowning stones, laid in a
circle on the highest rock in the portage, with wreaths of herbage and
branches.  There have been examples of men taking seven packages of
ninety pounds each, at one end of the portage, and putting them down at
the other without stopping.</p>

<p>To this another small portage immediately succeeds, over a rock
producing a fall.  From thence to the fall of Terre Blanche is two miles
and an half; to the first portage Des Eaux qui Remuent is three miles;
to the next, of the same name, is but a few yards distant; to the third
and last, which is a Decharge, is three miles and an half; and from this
to the last Portage of the river, one mile and an half; and to the
establishment, or provision house, is two miles and an half.  Here also
the French had their principal inland depot, and got their canoes made.
It is here that the present traders, going to great distances, and where
provision is difficult to procure, receive a supply to carry them to the
Rainy Lake, or Lake Superior.  From the establishment to the entrance of
Lake Winipic, is four miles and an half, latitude 50. 37. North.</p>

<p>The country, soil, produce, and climate,  from Lake Superior to this
place, bear a general resemblance, with a predominance of rock and
water: the former is of the granite kind.  Where there is any soil it is
well covered with wood, such as oak, elm, ash of different kinds, maple
of two kinds, pines of various descriptions, among which are what I call
the cypress, with the hickory, ironwood, laird, poplar, cedar, black and
white birch, etc., etc.  Vast quantities of wild rice are seen
throughout the country, which the natives collect in the month of August
for their winter stores.<a name="hl8" href="#hr8">[8]</a> To the North
of fifty degrees it is hardly known, or at least does not come to maturity.
</p>

<p>Lake Winipic is the great reservoir of several large rivers, and
discharges itself by the River Nelson into Hudson's Bay.  The first in
rotation, next to that I have just described, is the Assiniboin, or Red
River, which at the distance of forty miles coastwise, disembogues on
the south west side of the Lake Winipic.  It alternately receives those
two denominations from its dividing, at the distance of about thirty
miles from the lake, into two large branches; The Eastern branch, called
the Red River, runs in a Southern direction to near the head waters of
 the Mississippi.
On this are two trading establishments.  The country
on either side is but partially supplied with wood, and consists of
plains covered with herds of the buffalo and elk, especially on the
Western side.  On the Eastern side are lakes and rivers, and the whole
country is well wooded, level, abounding in beaver, bears, moose-deer,
fallow deer, etc., etc.  The natives, who are of the Algonquin tribe,
are not very numerous, and are considered as the natives of Lake
Superior.  This country being near the Mississippi, is also inhabited by
the Nadowasis, who are the natural enemies of the former; the head of
the water being the war-line, they are in a continual state of
hostility; and though the Algonquins are equally brave, the others
generally out-number them; it is very probable, therefore, that if the
latter continue to venture out of the woods, which form their only
protection, they will soon be extirpated.  There is not, perhaps, a
finer country in the world for the residence of uncivilised man, than
that which occupies the space between this river and Lake Superior.  It
abounds in every thing necessary to the wants and comforts of such a
people.  Fish, venison, and fowl, with wild rice, are in great plenty;
while, at the same time, their subsistence requires that bodily exercise
so necessary to health and vigour.</p>

 <p>This great extent
of country was formerly very populous, but from the information I received,
the aggregate of its inhabitants does not exceed three hundred warriors;
and, among the few whom I saw, it appeared to me that the widows were more
numerous than the men.  The raccoon is a native of this country, but is
seldom found to the Northward of it.</p>

<p>The other branch is called after the tribe of the Nadowasis, who here go
by the name of Assiniboins, and are the principal inhabitants of it.  It
runs from the North-North-West, and in the latitude of 51. 15. West, and
longitude 103. 20., rising in the same mountains as the river Dauphin,
of which I shall speak in due order.  They must have separated from
their nation at a time beyond our knowledge, and live in peace with the
Algonquins and Knisteneaux.</p>

<p>The country between this and the Red River, is almost a continual plain
to the Mississoury.  The soil is sand and gravel, with a slight
intermixture of earth, and produces a short grass.  Trees are very rare;
nor are there on the banks of the river sufficient, except in particular
spots, to build houses and supply fire-wood for the trading
establishments, of which there are four principal ones.  Both these
rivers are navigable for canoes to their source, without a fall; though
in some 
parts there are rapids, caused by occasional beds of limestone,
and gravel; but in general they have a sandy bottom.</p>

<p>The Assiniboins, and some of the Fall or Big-bellied Indians, are the
principal inhabitants of this country, and border on the river,
occupying the centre part of it; that next Lake Winipic, and about its
source, being the station of the Algonquins and Knisteneaux, who have
chosen it in preference to their own country.  They do not exceed five
hundred families.  They are not beaver hunters, which accounts for their
allowing the division just mentioned, as the lower and upper parts of
this river have those animals, which are not found in the intermediate
district.  They confine themselves to hunting the buffalo, and trapping
wolves, which cover the country.  What they do not want of the former
for raiment and food, they sometimes make into pemmican, or pounded
meat, while they melt the fat, and prepare the skins in their hair, for
winter.  The wolves they never eat, but produce a tallow from their fat,
and prepare their skins; all which they bring to exchange for arms and
ammunition, rum, tobacco, knives, and various baubles, with those who go
to traffic in their country.</p>

<p>The Algonquins, and the Knisteneaux, on the contrary, attend to the
fur-hunting, so that they acquire the additional articles of  cloth, blankets, etc., but their
passion for rum often puts it out of their power to supply themselves with
real necessaries.</p>

<p>The next river of magnitude is the river Dauphin, which empties itself
at the head of St. Martin's Bay, on the West side of the Lake Winipic,
latitude nearly 52. 15. North, taking its source in the same mountains
as the last-mentioned river, as well as the Swan and Red-Deer rivers,
the latter passing through the lake of the same name, as well as the
former, and both continuing their course through the Manitoba Lake,
which, from thence, runs parallel with Lake Winipic, to within nine
miles of the Red River, and by what is called the river Dauphin,
disembogues its waters, as already described, into that lake.  These
rivers are very rapid, and interrupted by falls, etc., the bed being
generally rocky.  All this country, to the South branch of the
Saskatchiwine, abounds in beaver, moose-deer, fallow-deer, elks, bears,
buffaloes, etc.  The soil is good, and wherever any attempts have been
made to raise the esculent plants, etc., it has been found productive.</p>

<p>On these waters are three principal forts for trade.  Fort Dauphin,
which was established by the French before the conquest.  Red-Deer
River, and Swan-River Forts, with occasional detached posts from these.
The 
inhabitants are the Knisteneaux, from the North of Lake Winipic; and
Algonquins from the country between the Red River and Lake Superior; and
some from the Rainy Lake: but as they are not fixed inhabitants, their
number cannot be determined: they do not, however, at any time exceed
two hundred warriors.  In general they are good hunters.  There is no
other considerable river except the Saskatchiwine, which I shall mention
presently, that empties itself into the Lake Winipic.</p>

<p>Those on the North side are inconsiderable, owing to the comparative
vicinity of the high land that separates the waters coming this way,
from those discharging into Hudson's Bay.  The course of the lake is
about West-North-West and South-South-East, and the East end of it is in
50. 37. North.  It contracts at about a quarter of its length to a
strait, in latitude 51. 45., and is no more than two miles broad, where
the South shore is gained through islands, and crossing various bays to
the discharge of the Saskatchiwine, in latitude 53. 15.  This lake, in
common with those of this country, is bounded on the North with banks of
black and grey rock, and on the South by a low level country,
occasionally interrupted with a ridge or bank of lime-stones, lying in
stratas, and rising to the perpendicular height of from  twenty to forty feet;
these are covered with a small quantity of earth, forming a level
surface, which bears timber, but of a moderate growth, and declines to a
swamp.  Where the banks are low, it is evident in many places that the
waters are withdrawn, and never rise to those heights which were
formerly washed by them.</p>

<p>The inhabitants who are found along this lake are of the Knisteneaux and
Algonquin tribes, and but few in number, though game is not scarce, and
there is fish in great abundance.  The black bass is found there, and no
further West; and beyond it no maple trees are seen, either hard or
soft.</p>

<p>On entering the Saskatchiwine, in the course of a few miles, the great
rapid interrupts the passage.  It is about three miles long.  Through
the greatest part of it the canoe is towed, half or full laden,
according to the state of the waters: the canoe and its contents are
then carried one thousand one hundred paces.  The channel here is near a
mile wide, the waters tumbling over ridges of rocks that traverse the
river.  The South bank is very high, rising upwards of fifty feet, of
the same rock as seen on the South side of the Lake Winipic, and the
North is not more than a third of that height.  There is an excellent
sturgeon-fishery at the foot of this cascade, and vast numbers of
pelicans, 
cormorants, etc., frequent it, where they watch to seize the
fish that may be killed or disabled by the force of the waters.</p>

<p>About two miles from this Portage the navigation is again interrupted by
the Portage of the Roche Rouge, which is an hundred yards long; and a
mile and an half from thence the river is barred by a range of islands,
forming rapids between them; and through these it is the same distance
to the rapid of Lake Travers, which is four miles right across, and
eight miles in length.  Then succeeds the Grande Decharge, and several
rapids, for four miles to the Cedar Lake, which is entered through a
small channel on the left, formed by an island, as going round it would
occasion loss of time.  In this distance banks of rocks (such as have
already been described) appear at intervals on, either side; the rest of
the country is low.  This is the case along the South bank of the lake
and the islands, while the North side, which is very uncommon, is level
throughout.  This lake runs first West four miles, then as much more
West-South-West, across a deep bay on the right, then six miles to the
Point de Lievre, and across another bay again on the right; then
North-West eight miles, across a still deeper hay on the right; and
seven miles parallel with the North coast, North-North-West through
islands, five miles more 
to Fort Bourbon,<a name="hl9" href="#hr9">[9]</a> situated on a small island,
dividing this from Mud Lake.</p>

<p>The Cedar Lake is from four to twelve miles wide, exclusive, of the
bays.  Its banks are covered with wood, and abound in game, and its
waters produce plenty of fish, particularly the sturgeon.  The Mud Lake,
and the neighbourhood of the Fort Bourbon, abound with geese, ducks,
swans, etc., and was formerly remarkable for a vast number of martens,
of which it cannot now boast but a very small proportion.</p>

<p>The Mud Lake must have formerly been a part of the Cedar Lake, but the
immense quantity of earth and sand, brought down by the Saskatchiwine,
has filled up this part of it for a circumference whose diameter is at
least fifteen or twenty miles: part of which space is still covered with
a few feet of water, but the greatest proportion is shaded with large
trees, such as the liard, the swamp-ash, and the willow.  This land
consists of many islands, which consequently form various channels,
several of which are occasionally dry, and bearing young wood.  It is,
indeed, more than probable that this river will, in the course of time,
convert the whole of the Cedar Lake into a forest.  To the North-West
the cedar is not to be found.</p>

<p> From this lake
the Saskatchiwine may be considered as navigable to near its source in
the rocky mountains, for canoes, and without a carrying-place, making a
great bend to Cumberland House, on Sturgeon Lake.  From the confluence
of its North and South branches its course is Westerly; spreading
itself, it receives several tributary streams, and encompasses a large
tract of country, which is level, particularly along the South branch,
but is little known.  Beaver, and other animals, whose furs are
valuable, are amongst the inhabitants of the North-West branch, and the
plains are covered with buffaloes, wolves, and small foxes; particularly
about the South branch, which, however, has of late claimed some
attention, as it is now understood, that where the plains terminate
towards the rocky mountain, there is a space of hilly country clothed
with wood, and inhabited also by animals of the fur kind.  This has been
actually determined to be the case towards the head of the North branch,
where the trade has been carried to about the latitude 54. North, and
longitude 114. 30. West.  The bed and banks of the latter, in some few
places, discover a stratum of free-stone; but, in general, they are
composed of earth and sand.  The plains are sand and gravel, covered
with fine grass, and mixed with a small quantity of vegetable earth,
This is  particularly
observable along the North branch, the West side of which is covered
with wood.
</p>

<p>There are on this river five principal factories for the convenience
of trade with the natives.  Nepawi House, South-branch House,
Fort-George House, Fort-Augustus House, and Upper Establishment.  There
have been many others, which, from various causes, have been changed for
these, while there are occasionally others depending on each of
them.</p>

<p>The inhabitants, from the information I could obtain, are as follow:</p>

<p>At Nepawi and South-Branch House, about thirty tents of Knisteneaux,
or ninety warriors; and sixty tents of Stone Indians, or Assiniboins,
who are their neighbours, and are equal to two hundred men: their
hunting ground extends upwards to about the Eagle Hills.  Next to them
are those who trade at Forts George and Augustus, and are about eighty
tents or upwards of Knisteneaux: on either side of the river, their
number may be two hundred.  In the same country are one hundred and
forty tents of Stone Indians: not quite half of them inhabit the West
woody country; the others never leave the plains, and their numbers
cannot be less than four hundred and fifty men.  At the Southern
Head-waters of the North-branch dwells a tribe called Sarsees,
consisting of about
 thirty-five tents,
or one hundred and twenty men.  Opposite to those Eastward, on the
head-waters of the South Branch, are the Picaneaux, to the number of from
twelve to fifteen hundred men.  Next to them, on the same water,
are the Blood-Indians, of the same nation as the last, to the number
of about fifty tents, or two hundred and fifty men.  From them
downwards extend the Black-Feet Indians, of the same nation as the two
last tribes: their number may be eight hundred men.  Next to them,
and who extend to the confluence of the South and North branch, are the
Fall, or Big-bellied Indians, who may amount to about six hundred
warriors.</p>

<p>Of all these different tribes, those who inhabit the broken country on
the North-West side, and the source of the North branch, are
beaver-hunters; the others deal in provisions, wolf, buffalo, and fox
skins; and many people on the South branch do not trouble themselves to
come near the trading establishments.  Those who do, choose such
establishments as are next to their country.  The Stone-Indians here,
are the same people as the Stone-Indians, or Assiniboins, who inhabit
the river of that name already described, and both are detached tribes
from the Nadowasis, who inhabit the Western side of the Mississippi, and
lower part of the 
Missisoury.  The Fall, or Big-bellied Indians, are
from the South-Eastward also, and of a people who inhabit the plains
from the North bend of the last mentioned river, latitude 47.
32. North, longitude 101. 25. West, to the South bend of the Assiniboin
River, to the number of seven hundred men.  Some of them occasionally
come to the latter river to exchange dressed buffalo robes and bad
wolf-skins for articles of no great value.</p>

<p>The Picaneaux, Black-Feet, and Blood-Indians, are a distinct people,
speak a language of their own, and, I have reason to think, are
travelling North-West, as well as the others just mentioned: nor have I
heard of any Indians with whose language that which they speak has any
affinity.—They are the people who deal in horses, and take them upon
the war-parties towards Mexico; from which, it is evident, that the
country to the South-East of them consists of plains, as those animals
could not well be conducted through an hilly and woody country,
intersected by waters.</p>

<p>The Sarsees, who are but few in number, appear from their language, to
come on the contrary from the North-West, and are of the same people as
the Rocky-Mountain Indians described in my second journal, who are a
tribe of the Chepewyans; and, as for the Knisteneaux, there is no
question of their 
having been, and continuing to be, invaders of this
country, from the Eastward.  Formerly, they struck terror into all the
other tribes whom they met; but now they have lost the respect that was
paid them; as those whom they formerly considered as barbarians are now
their allies, and consequently become better acquainted with them, and
have acquired the use of fire-arms.  The former are still proud without
power, and affect to consider the others as their inferiors: those
consequently are extremely jealous of them, and, depending upon their
own superiority in numbers, will not submit tamely to their insults; so
that the consequences often prove fatal, and the Knisteneaux are thereby
decreasing both in power and number; spirituous liquors also tend to
their diminution, as they are instigated thereby to engage in quarrels
which frequently have the most disastrous termination among themselves.</p>

<p>The Stone-Indians must not be considered in the same point of view
respecting the Knisteneaux, for they have been generally obliged, from
various causes, to court their alliance.  They, however, are not without
their disagreements, and it is sometimes very difficult to compose their
differences.  These quarrels occasionally take place with the traders,
and sometimes have a tragical conclusion.  They generally originate in
 consequence of
stealing women and horses: they have great numbers of the latter
throughout their plains, which are brought, as has been observed,
from the Spanish settlements in Mexico; and many of them have been seen
even in the back parts of this country, branded with the initials of
their original owners' names.  Those horses are distinctly employed as
beasts of burden, and to chase the buffalo.  The former are not
considered as being of much value, as they may be purchased for a gun,
which costs no more than twenty-one shillings in Great Britain.  Many of
the hunters cannot be purchased with ten, the comparative value of which
exceeds the property of any native.</p>

<p>Of these useful animals no care whatever is taken, as when they are no
longer employed, they are turned loose winter and summer to provide for
themselves.  Here, it is to be observed, that the country, in general,
on the West and North side of this great river, is broken by the lakes
and rivers with small intervening plains, where the soil is good, and
the grass grows to some length.  To these the male buffaloes resort for
the winter, and if it be very severe, the females also are obliged to
leave the plains.</p>

<p>But to return to the route by which the progress West and North is made
through this continent.</p>

<p>We leave the
Saskatchiwine<a name="hl10" href="#hr10">[10]</a> by entering the river
which forms the discharge of the Sturgeon Lake, on whose East bank is situated
Cumberland house, in latitude 53. 56. North, longitude 102. 15.  The
distance between the entrance and Cumberland house is estimated at
twenty miles.</p>

<p>It is very evident that the mud which is carried down by the
Saskatchiwine River, has formed the land that lies between it and the
lake, for the distance of upwards of twenty miles in the line of the
river, which is inundated during one half of the summer, though covered
with wood.  This lake forms an irregular horse-shoe, one side of which
runs to the North-West, and bears the name of Pine-Island Lake, and the
other, known by the name already mentioned, runs to the East of North,
and is the largest: its length is about twenty-seven miles, and its
greatest breadth about six miles.  The North side of the latter is the
same kind of rock as that described in Lake Winipic, on the West shore.
In latitude 54. 16. North, the Sturgeon-Weir River discharges itself
into this lake, and its bed 
appears to be of the same kind of rock, and
is almost a continual rapid.  Its direct course is about West by North,
and with its windings, is about thirty miles.  It takes its waters into
the Beaver Lake the South-West side of which consists of the same rock
lying in thin stratas: the route then proceeds from island to island for
about twelve miles, and along the North shore, for four miles more, the
whole being a North-West course to the entrance of a river, in latitude
54. 32. North.  The lake, for this distance, is about four or five miles
wide, and abounds with fish common to the country.  The part of it upon
the right of that which has been described, appears more considerable.
The islands are rocky, and the lake itself surrounded by rocks.  The
communication from hence to the Bouleau Lake, alternately narrows into
rivers and spreads into small lakes.  The interruptions are, the Pente
Portage, which is succeeded by the Grand Rapid, where there is a
Decharge, the Carp Portage, the Bouleau Portage in latitude
54. 50. North, including a distance, together with the windings, of
thirty-four miles, in a Westerly direction.  The Lake de Bouleau then
follows.  This lake might with greater propriety be denominated a canal,
as it is not more than a mile in breadth.  Its course is rather to the
East of North for twelve miles to Portage de  L'Isle.  From thence there
is still water to Portage d'Epinettes, except an adjoining rapid.  The
distance is not more than four miles Westerly.  After crossing this
Portage, it is not more than two miles to Lake Miron, which is in
latitude 55. 7. North.  Its length is about twelve miles, and its
breadth irregular, from two to ten miles.  It is only separated from
Lake du Chitique, or Pelican Lake, by a short, narrow, and small strait.
That lake is not more than seven miles long, and its course about
North-West.  The Lake des Bois then succeeds, the passage to which is
through small lakes, separated by falls and rapids.  The first is a
Decharge: then follow the three galets, in immediate succession.  From
hence Lake des Bois runs about twenty-one miles.  Its course is
South-South-East, and North-North-West, and is full of islands.  The
passage continues through an intricate, narrow, winding, and shallow
channel for eight miles.  The interruptions in this distance are
frequent, but depend much on the state of the waters.  Having passed
them, it is necessary to cross the Portage de Traite, or, as it is
called by the Indians, Athiquisipichigan Ouinigam, or the Portage of the
Stretched Frog Skin, to the Missinipi.  The waters already described
discharge themselves into Lake Winipic, and augment those of the river
Nelson.  These 
which we are now entering are called the Missinipi, or great Churchill River.
</p>

<p>All the country to the South and East of this, within the line of the
progress that has been described, is interspersed by lakes, hills, and
rivers, and is full or animals, of the fur-kind, as well as the
moose-deer.  Its inhabitants are the Knisteneaux Indians, who are called
by the servants of the Hudson's Bay Company, at York, their
home-guards.</p>

<p>The traders from Canada succeeded for several years in getting the
largest proportion of their furs, till the year 1793, when the servants
of that company thought proper to send people amongst them, (and why
they did not do it before is best known to themselves), for the purpose
of trade, and securing their credits, which the Indians were apt to
forget.  From the short distance they had to come, and the quantity of
goods they supplied, the trade has, in a great measure, reverted to
them, as the merchants from Canada could not meet them upon equal terms.
What added to the loss of the latter, was the murder of one of their
traders by the Indians, about this period.  Of these people not above
eighty men have been known to the traders from Canada, but they consist
of a much greater number.</p>

<p>The Portage de Traite, as has been already hinted, received its name
from Mr. Joseph 
Frobisher, who penetrated into this part of the country from Canada, as
early as the years 1774 and 1775, where he met with the Indians in the
spring, on their way to Churchill, according to annual custom, with
their canoes full of valuable furs.  They traded with him for as many of
them as his canoes could carry, and in consequence of this transaction,
the Portage received and has since retained its present appellation.  He
also denominated these waters the English River.  The Missinipi is the
name which it received from the Knisteneaux, when they first came to
this country, and either destroyed or drove back the natives, whom they
held in great contempt, on many accounts, but particularly for their
ignorance in hunting the beaver, as well as in preparing, stretching,
and drying the skins of those animals.  And as a sign of their derision,
they stretched the skin of a frog, and hung it up at the Portage.  This
was, at that time, the utmost extent of their conquest or war-faring
progress West, and is in latitude 55.  25. North, and longitude
103. 45. West.  The river here, which bears the appearance of a lake,
takes its name from the Portage, and is full of islands.  It runs from
East to West about sixteen miles, and is from four to five miles broad.
Then succeed falls and cascades which form what is called the
grand  rapid.  From
thence there is a succession of small lakes and rivers, interrupted by
rapids and falls, viz., the Portage de Bareel, the Portage de L'Isle,
and that of the Rapid River. The course is twenty miles from
East-South-East to North-North-West. The Rapid-River Lake then runs West
five miles, and is of an oval form. The rapid river is the discharge of
Lake la Ronge, where there has been an establishment for trade from the
year 1782.  Since the small-pox ravaged these parts, there have been but
few inhabitants; these are of the Knisteneaux tribe, and do not exceed
thirty men.  The direct navigation continues to be through rivers and
canals, interrupted by rapids; and the distance to the first Decharge is
four miles, in a Westerly direction.  Then follows Lake de la Montagne,
which runs South-South-West three miles and an half, then North six
miles, through narrow channels, formed by islands, and continues
North-North-West five miles, to the portage of the same name, which is
no sooner crossed, than another appears in sight, leading to the Otter
Lake, from whence it is nine miles Westerly to the Otter Portage, in
latitude 55. 39.  Between this and the Portage du Diable, are several
rapids, and the distance three miles and an half.  Then succeeds the
lake of the same name, running from South-East to
North-West,  five
miles, and West four miles and an half.</p>

<p>There is then a succession of small lakes, rapids, and falls,
producing the Portage des Ecors, Portage du Galet, and Portage des
Morts, the whole comprehending a distance of six miles, to the lake of
the latter name.  On the left side is a point covered with human bones,
the relics of the small-pox; which circumstance gave the Portage and the
lake this melancholy denomination.  Its course is South-West fifteen
miles, while its breadth does not exceed three miles.  From thence a
rapid river leads to Portage de Hallier, which is followed by Lake de
Isle d'Ours: it is, however, improperly called a lake, as it contains
frequent impediments amongst its islands, from rapids.  There is a very
dangerous one about the centre of it, which is named the Rapid qui ne
parle point, or that never speaks, from its silent whirlpool-motion.  In
some of the whirlpools the suction is so powerful, that they are
carefully avoided.  At some distance from the silent rapid is a narrow
strait, where the Indians have painted red figures on the face of a
rock, and where it was their custom formerly to make an offering of some
of the articles which they had with them, in their way to and from
Churchill.  The course of this lake, which is very meandering, may be
estimated  at
thirty-eight miles, and is terminated by the Portage du Canot Tourner,
from the danger to which those are subject who venture to run this
rapid.  From thence a river of one mile and an half North-West course
leads to the Portage de Bouleau, and in about half a mile to Portage des
Epingles, so called from the sharpness of its stones.  Then follows the
Lake des Souris, the direction across which is amongst islands,
North-West by West six miles.  In this traverse is an island, which is
remarkable for a very large stone, in the form of a bear, on which the
natives have painted the head and snout of that animal; and here they
also were formerly accustomed to offer sacrifices.  This lake is
separated only by a narrow strait from the Lake du Serpent, which runs
North-North-West seven miles, to a narrow channel, that connects it with
another lake, bearing the same name, and running the same course for
eleven miles, when the rapid of the same denomination is entered on the
West side of the lake.  It is to be remarked here, that for about three
or four miles on the North-West side of this lake, there is an high bank
of clay and sand, clothed with cypress trees, a circumstance which is
not observable on any lakes hitherto mentioned, as they are bounded,
particularly on the North, by black and grey rocks.  It may
also  be
considered as a most extraordinary circumstance, that the Chepewyans go
North-West from hence to the barren grounds, which are their own
country, without the assistance of canoes; as it is well known that in
every other part which has been described, from Cumberland House, the
country is broken on either side of the direction to a great extent: so
that a traveller could not go at right angles with any of the waters
already mentioned, without meeting with others in every eight or ten
miles.  This will also be found to be very much the case in proceeding
to Portage la Loche.</p>

<p>The last mentioned rapid is upwards of three miles long, North-West
by West; there is, however, no carrying, as the line and poles are
sufficient to drag and set the canoes against the current.  Lake Croche
is then crossed in a Westerly direction of six miles, though its whole
length may be twice that distance: after which it contracts to a river
that runs Westerly for ten miles, when it forms a bend, which is left to
the South, and entering a portion of its waters called the Grass River,
whose meandering course is about six miles, but in a direct line not
more than half that length, where it receives its waters from the great
river, which then runs Westerly eleven miles before it forms the Knee
Lake, whose direction is to the
North  of West.
It is full of islands for eighteen miles, and its greatest apparent
breadth is not more than five miles.  The portage of the same name is
several hundred yards long, and over large stones.  Its latitude is
55. 50. and longitude 106. 30.  Two miles further North is the
commencement of the Croche Rapid, which is a succession of cascades for
about three miles, making a bend due South to the Lake du Primeau, whose
course is various, and through islands, to the distance of about fifteen
miles.  The banks of this lake are low, stony, and marshy, whose grass
and rushes afford shelter and food to great numbers of wild fowl.  At
its Western extremity is Portage la Puise, from whence the river takes a
meandering course, widening and contracting at intervals, and is much
interrupted by rapids.  After a Westerly course of twenty miles, it
reaches Portage Pellet.  From hence, in the course of seven miles, are
three rapids, to which succeeds the Shagoina Lake, which may be eighteen
miles in circumference.  Then Shagoina strait and rapid lead into the
Lake of Isle a la Crosse, in which the course is South twenty miles, and
South-South-West fourteen miles, to the Point au Sable; opposite to
which is the discharge of the Beaver-River, bearing South six miles: the
lake in the distance run, does not exceed twelve miles in its
greatest 
breadth.  It now turns West-South-West, the Isle a la Crosse being on
the South, and the main land on the North; and it clears the one and the
other in the distance of three miles, the water presenting an open
horizon to right and left; that on the left formed by a deep narrow bay,
about ten leagues in depth; and that to the right by what is called la
Riviere Creuse, or Deep River, being a canal of still water, which is
here four miles wide.  On following the last course, Isle a la Crosse
Fort appears on a low isthmus, at the distance of five miles, and is in
latitude 55. 25. North, and longitude 107. 48. West.</p>

<p>This lake and fort take their names from the island just mentioned,
which, as has been already observed, received its denomination from the
game of the cross, which forms a principal amusement among the natives.</p>

<p>The situation of this lake, the abundance of the finest fish in the
world to be found in its waters, the richness of its surrounding banks
and forests, in moose and fallow deer, with the vast numbers of the
smaller tribes of animals, whose skins are precious, and the numerous
flocks of wild fowl that frequent it in the spring and fall, make it a
most desirable spot for the constant residence of some, and the
occasional rendezvous of  others of the inhabitants of the country,
particularly of the Knisteneaux.</p>

<p>Who the original people were that were driven from it, when conquered by
the Knisteneaux, is not now known, as not a single vestige remains of
them.  The latter, and the Chepewyans, are the only people that have
been known here; and it is evident that the last-mentioned consider
themselves as strangers, and seldom remain longer than three or four
years, without visiting their relations and friends in the barren
grounds, which they term their native country.  They were for some time
treated by the Knisteneaux as enemies; who now allow them to hunt to the
North of the track which has been described, from Fort du Traite
upwards, but when they occasionally meet them, they insist on
contributions, and frequently punish resistance with their arms.  This
is sometimes done at the forts, or places of trade, but then it appears
to be a voluntary gift.  A treat of rum is expected on the occasion,
which the Chepewyans on no other account ever purchase; and those only
who have had frequent intercourse with the Knisteneaux have any
inclination to drink it.</p>

<p>When the Europeans first penetrated into this country, in 1777, the
people of both tribes were numerous, but the small-pox was fatal to them
all, so that there does not exist  of the one, at present, more than
forty resident families; and the other has been from about thirty to two
hundred families.  These numbers are applicable to the constant and less
ambitious inhabitants, who are satisfied with the quiet possession of a
country affording, without risk or much trouble, every thing necessary
to their comfort; for since traders have spread themselves over it, it
is no more the rendezvous of the errant Knisteneaux, part of whom used
annually to return thither from the country of the Beaver River, which
they had explored to its source in their war and hunting excursions, and
as far as the Saskatchiwine, where they sometimes met people of their
own nation, who had prosecuted similar conquests up that river.  In that
country they found abundance of fish and animals, such as have been
already described, with the addition of the buffaloes, who range in the
partial patches of meadow scattered along the rivers and lakes.  From
thence they returned in the spring to their friends whom they had left;
and, at the same time met with others who had penetrated with the same
designs into the Athabasca country, which will be described hereafter.</p>

<p>The spring was the period of this joyful meeting, when their time was
occupied in feasting, dancing, and other pastimes, which  were
occasionally suspended for sacrifice, and religious solemnity: while the
narratives of their travels, and the history of their wars, amused and
animated the festival.  The time of rejoicing was but short, and was
soon interrupted by the necessary preparations for their annual journey
to Churchill, to exchange their furs for such European articles as were
now become necessary to them.  The shortness of the seasons, and the
great length of their way requiring the utmost despatch, the most active
men of the tribe, with their youngest women, and a few of their children
undertook the voyage, under the direction of some of their chiefs,
following the waters already described, to their discharge at Churchill
Factory, which are called, as has already been observed, the Missinipi,
or Great Waters.  There they remained no longer than was sufficient to
barter their commodities, with a supernumerary day or two to gratify
themselves with the indulgence of spirituous liquors.  At the same time
the inconsiderable quantity they could purchase to carry away with them,
for a regale with their friends, was held sacred, and reserved to
heighten the enjoyment of their return home, when the amusements,
festivity, and religious solemnities of the spring were repeated.  The
usual time appropriated to these convivialities being completed, they
separated, to 
pursue their different objects; and if they were determined to go to war
they made the necessary arrangements for their future operations.</p>

<p>But we must now renew the progress of the route.  It is not more than
two miles from Isle a la Crosse Fort, to a point of land which forms a
cheek of that part of the lake called the Riviere Creuse, which
preserves the breadth already mentioned for upwards of twenty miles;
then contracts to about two, for the distance of ten miles more, when it
opens to Lake Clear, which is very wide, and commands an open horizon,
keeping the West shore for six miles.  The whole of the distance
mentioned is about North-West, when, by a narrow, crooked channel,
turning to the South of West, the entry is made into Lake du Boeuf,
which is contracted near the middle, by a projecting sandy point;
independent of which it may be described as from six to twelve miles in
breadth, thirty-six miles long, and in a North-West direction.  At the
North-West end, in latitude 56. 8. it receives the waters of the river
la Loche, which, in the fall of the year, is very shallow, and navigated
with difficulty even by half-laden canoes.  Its water is not sufficient
to form strong rapids, though from its rocky bottom the canoes are
frequently in considerable danger.  Including its meanders,
the course of
this river may be computed at twenty-four miles, and receives its first
waters from the lake of the same name, which is about twenty miles long,
and six wide; into which a small river flows, sufficient to bear loaded
canoes, for about a mile and an half, where the navigation ceases; and
the canoes, with their lading, are carried over the Portage la Loche for
thirteen miles.</p>

<p>This portage is the ridge that divides the waters which discharge
themselves into Hudson's Bay, from those that flow into the Northern
ocean, and is in the latitude 56. 20.  and longitude 109. 15. West.  It
runs South-West until it loses its local height between the
Saskatchiwine and Elk Rivers; close on the bank of the former, in
latitude 53. 36. North, and longitude 113. 45. West, it may be traced in
an Easterly direction toward latitude 58. 12. North, and longitude
103½. West, when it appears to take its course due North, and may
probably reach the Frozen Seas.</p>

<p>From Lake le Souris, the banks of the rivers and lakes display a smaller
portion of solid rock.  The land is low and stony, intermixed with a
light, sandy soil, and clothed with wood.  That of the Beaver River is
of a more productive quality: but no part of it has ever been cultivated
by the natives or Europeans, except a small garden at the Isle
 a la
Crosse, which well repaid the labour bestowed upon it.</p>

<p>The Portage la Loche is of a level surface, in some parts abounding with
stones, but in general it is an entire sand, and covered with the
cypress, the pine, the spruce fir, and other trees natural to its soil.
Within three miles of the North-West termination, there is a small round
lake, whose diameter does not exceed a mile, and which affords a
trifling respite to the labour of carrying.  Within a mile of the
termination of the Portage is a very steep precipice, whose ascent and
descent appears to be equally impracticable in any way, as it consists
of a succession of eight hills, some of which are almost perpendicular;
nevertheless, the Canadians contrive to surmount all these difficulties,
even with their canoes and lading.</p>

<p>This precipice, which rises upwards of a thousand feet above the
plain beneath it, commands a most extensive, romantic, and ravishing
prospect.  From thence the eye looks down on the course of the little
river, by some called the Swan river, and by others, the Clear-Water and
Pelican river, beautifully meandering for upwards of thirty miles.  The
valley, which is at once refreshed and adorned by it, is about three
miles in breadth, and is confined by two lofty ridges of equal height,
displaying a most
beautiful 
intermixture of wood and lawn, and stretching on till the blue mist
obscures the prospect.  Some parts of the inclining heights are covered
with stately forests, relieved by promontories of the finest verdure,
where the elk and buffalo find pasture.  These are contrasted by spots
where fire has destroyed the woods, and left a dreary void behind it.
Nor, when I beheld this wonderful display of uncultivated nature, was
the moving scenery of human occupation wanting to complete the picture.
From this elevated situation, I beheld my people, diminished, as it
were, to half their size, employed in pitching their tents in a charming
meadow, and among the canoes, which, being turned upon their sides,
presented their reddened bottoms in contrast with the surrounding
verdure.  At the same time, the process of gumming them produced
numerous small spires of smoke, which, as they rose, enlivened the
scene, and at length blended with the larger columns that ascended from
the fires where the suppers were preparing.  It was in the month of
September when I enjoyed a scene, of which I do not presume to give an
adequate description; and as it was the rutting season of the elk, the
whistling of that animal was heard in all the variety which the echoes
could afford it.</p>

<p>This river, which waters and reflects such enchanting scenery, runs,
including its 
windings, upwards of eighty miles, when it discharges itself in the Elk
River, according to the denomination of the natives, but commonly called
by the white people, the Athabasca River, in latitude 56. 42. North.</p>

<p>At a small distance from Portage la Loche, several carrying-places
interrupt the navigation of the river; about the middle of which are
some mineral springs, whose margins are covered with sulphureous
incrustations.  At the junction or fork, the Elk River is about three
quarters of a mile in breadth, and runs in a steady current, sometimes
contracting, but never increasing its channel, till, after receiving
several small streams, it discharges itself into the Lake of the Hills,
in latitude 58. 36. North.  At about twenty-four miles from the Fork,
are some bituminous fountains, into which a pole of twenty feet long may
be inserted without the least resistance.  The bitumen is in a fluid
state, and when mixed with gum, or the resinous substance collected from
the spruce fir, serves to gum the canoes.  In its heated state it emits
a smell like that of sea-coal.  The banks of the river, which are there
very elevated, discover veins of the same bituminous quality.  At a
small distance from the Fork, houses have been erected for the
convenience of trading with a party of the Knisteneaux, who visit the
adjacent country for the purpose of
hunting.  At
the distance of about forty miles from the lake, is the Old
Establishment, which has been already mentioned, as formed by Mr. Pond
in the year 1778-9, and which was the only one in this part of the
world, till the year 1785.  In the year 1788 it was transferred to the
Lake of the Hills, and formed on a point on its Southern side, at about
eight miles from the discharge of the river.  It was named Fort
Chepewyan, and is in latitude 58. 38. North, longitude 110. 26. West,
and much better situated for trade and fishing as the people here have
recourse to water for their support.</p>

<p>This being the place which I made my headquarters for eight years, and
from whence I took my departure, on both my expeditions, I shall give
some account of it, with the manner of carrying on the trade there, and
other circumstances connected with it.</p>

<p>The laden canoes which leave Lake la Pluie about the first of August,
do not arrive here till the latter end of September, or the beginning of
October, when a necessary proportion of them is despatched up the Peace
River to trade with the Beaver and Rocky-Mountain Indians.  Others are
sent to the Slave River and Lake, or beyond them, and traffic with the
inhabitants of that country.  A small part of them, if not left at the
Fork of the Elk River, return thither for
the 
Knisteneaux, while the rest of the people and merchandise remain here,
to carry on trade with the Chepewyans.</p>

<p>Here have I arrived with ninety or an hundred men without any
provision for their sustenance; for whatever quantity might have been
obtained from the natives during the summer, it could not be more than
sufficient for the people despatched to their different posts; and even
if there were a casual superfluity, it was absolutely necessary to
preserve it untouched, for the demands of the spring.  The whole
dependence, therefore, of those who remained, was on the lake, and
fishing implements for the means of our support.  The nets are sixty
fathom in length, when set, and contain fifteen meshes of five inches in
depth.  The manner of using them is as follows: A small stone and wooden
buoy are fastened to the side-line opposite to each other, at about the
distance of two fathoms; when the net is carefully thrown into the
water, the stone sinks it to the bottom, while the buoy keeps it at its
full extent, and it is secured in its situation by a stone at either
end.  The nets are visited every day, and taken out every other day to
be cleaned and dried.  This is a very ready operation when the waters
are not frozen, but when the frost has set in, and the ice has acquired
its greatest thickness, which is sometimes as much as  five feet, holes are cut
in it at the distance of thirty feet from each other, to the full length
of the net; one of them is larger than the rest, being generally about
four feet square, and is called the basin: by means of them, and poles
of a proportionable length, the nets are placed in and drawn out of the
water.  The setting of hooks and lines is so simple an employment as to
render a description unnecessary.  The white fish are the principal
object of pursuit: they spawn in the fall of the year, and, at about the
setting in of the hard frost, crowd in shoals to the shallow water, when
as many as possible are taken, in order that a portion of them may be
laid by in the frost to provide against the scarcity of winter; as,
during that season, the fish of every description decrease in the lakes,
if they do not altogether disappear.  Some have supposed that during
this period they are stationary, or assume an inactive state.  If there
should be any intervals of warm weather during the fall, it is necessary
to suspend the fish by the tail, though they are not so good as those
which are altogether preserved by the frost.  In this state they remain
to the beginning of April, when they have been found as sweet as when
they were caught.<a name="hl11" href="#hr11">[11]</a></p>

<p> Thus do
these voyagers live, year after year, entirely upon fish, without even
the quickening flavour of salt, or the variety of any farinaceous root
or vegetable.  Salt, however, if their habits had not rendered it
unnecessary, might be obtained in this country to the Westward of the
Peace River, where it loses its name in that of the Slave River, from
the numerous salt-ponds and springs to be found there, which will supply
in any quantity, in a state of concretion, and perfectly white and
clean.  When the Indians pass that way they bring a small quantity to
the fort, with other articles of traffic.</p>

<p>During a short period of the spring and fall, great numbers of wild
fowl frequent this country, which prove a very gratifying food after
such a long privation of flesh-meat.  It is remarkable, however, that
the Canadians who frequent the Peace, Saskatchiwine, and Assiniboin
rivers, and live altogether on venison, have a less healthy appearance
than those whose sustenance is obtained from the waters.  At the same
time the scurvy is wholly unknown among them.</p>

<p>In the fall of the year the natives meet the traders at the forts,
where they barter the furs or provisions which they may
have 
procured; they then obtain credit, and proceed to hunt the beavers, and
do not return till the beginning of the year; when they are again fitted
out in the same manner and come back the latter end of March, or the
beginning of April; They are now unwilling to repair to the beaver hunt
until the waters, are clear of ice, that they may kill them with
fire-arms, which the Chepewyans are averse to employ.  The major part of
the latter return to the barren grounds, and live during the summer with
their relations and friends in the enjoyment of that plenty which is
derived from numerous herds of deer.  But those of that tribe who are
most partial to these deserts, cannot remain there in winter, and they
are obliged, with the deer, to take shelter in the woods during that
rigorous season, when they contrive to kill a few beavers, and send them
by young men, to exchange for iron utensils and ammunition.</p>

<p>Till the year 1782, the people of Athabasca sent or carried their
furs regularly to Fort Churchill, Hudson's Bay; and some of them have,
since that time, repaired thither, notwithstanding they could have
provided themselves with all the necessaries which they required.  The
difference of the price set on goods here and at the factory, made it an
object with the Chepewyans to undertake a journey of five or six months,
in the
course  of
which they were reduced to the most painful extremities, and often lost
their lives from hunger and fatigue, At present, however, this traffic
is in a great measure discontinued, as they were obliged to expend in
the course of their journey, that very ammunition which was its most
alluring object.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="hr1" href="#hl1">[1]</a> This might be
properly called the stock of the company, as it included, with the
expenditure of the year, the amount of the property unexpended, which
had been appropriated for the adventure of that year, and was carried on
to the account of the following adventure.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="hr2" href="#hl2">[2]</a> This will be
better illustrated by the following statement:—We will suppose the
goods for 1798: The orders for the goods are sent to this country 25th
October, 1796; they are shipped from London March, 1797; they arrive in
Montreal June, 1797; they are made up in the course of that summer and
winter; they are sent from Montreal May, 1798; they arrive in the Indian
country, and are exchanged for furs the following winter, 1798-99; which
furs come to Montreal September, 1799; and are shipped for London; where
they are sold in March and April, and paid for in May or June, 1800.
</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="hr3" href="#hl3">[3]</a> The place where
the goods alone are carried, is called a <i>Decharge</i>, and that where
goods and canoes are both transported overland, is denominated
a <i>Portage</i>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="hr4" href="#hl4">[4]</a> In the year 1668,
when the first missionaries visited the South of this lake, they found
the country full of inhabitants.  They relate, that about this time a
band of the Nepisingues, who were converted, emigrated to the Nipigon
country, which is to the North of Lake Superior.  Few of their
descendants are now remaining, and not a trace of the religion
communicated to them is to be discovered.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="hr5" href="#hl5">[5]</a> Corn is the
cheapest provision that can be procured, though from the expense of
transport, the bushel costs about twenty shillings sterling, at the
Grande Portage.  A man's daily allowance does not exceed ten-pence.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="hr6" href="#hl6">[6] </a> Here is a most
excellent fishery for white fish, which are exquisite.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="hr7" href="#hl7">[7]</a> The route which we
have been travelling hitherto, leads along the high rocky land or bank
of Lake Superior on the left.  The face of the country offers a wild
scene of huge hills and rocks, separated by stony valleys, lakes and
ponds.  Wherever there is the least soil, it is well covered with
trees.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="hr8" href="#hl8">[8] </a> The fruits are,
strawberries, hurtleberries, plums, and cherries, hazelnuts,
gooseberries, currents, raspberries, poires, etc.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="hr9" href="#hl9">[9] </a> This was also a
principal post of the French, who gave it its name.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="hr10" href="#hl10">[10]</a> It may be
proper to observe, that the French had two settlements upon the
Saskatchiwine, long before, and at the conquest of Canada; the first at
the Pasquia, near Carrot River, and the other at Nipawi, where they had
agricultural instruments and wheel carriages, marks of both being found
about those establishments, where the soil is excellent.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="hr11" href="#hl11">[11]</a> This fishery
requires the most unremitting attention, as the voyaging Canadians are
equally indolent, extravagant, and improvident, when left to themselves,
and rival the savages in a neglect of the morrow.</p>

<h4>SOME ACCOUNT OF THE KNISTENEAUX INDIANS.</h4>


<p>
These people are spread over a vast extent of country.  Their language
is the same as that of the people who inhabit the coast of British
America on the Atlantic, with the exception of the Esquimaux,
<a name="kl1" href="#kr1">[1]</a> and continues along the coast of
Labrador, and the gulf and banks of St. Laurence to Montreal. The line
then follows the Utawas river to its source; and continues from thence
nearly West along the highlands which divides the waters that fall into
Lake Superior and Hudson's Bay.  It then proceeds till it strikes the
middle part of the river Winipic, following that water to the Lake
Winipic, to the discharge of the Saskatchiwine into it; from thence it
accompanies the latter to Fort George, when the line, striking by the
head of the Beaver river to the Elk river, runs along its banks to its
discharge in the Lake of the Hills; from which it may be carried
back East, to the
Isle a la Crosse, and so on to Churchill by the Missinipi, The whole of
the tract between this line and Hudson's Bay and Straits (except that of
the Esquimaux in the latter), may be said to be exclusively the country of
the Knisteneaux.  Some of them indeed, have penetrated further West and
South to the Red River, to the South of Lake Winipic, and the South branch
of the Saskatchiwine.</p>

<p>They are of a moderate stature, well proportioned, and of great
activity.  Examples of deformity are seldom to be seen among them.
Their complexion is of a copper colour, and their hair black, which is
common to all the natives of North America.  It is cut in various forms,
according to the fancy of the several tribes, and by some is left in the
long, lank, flow of nature.  They very generally extract their beards,
and both sexes manifest a disposition to pluck the hair from every part
of their body and limbs.  Their eyes are black, keen, and penetrating;
their countenance open and agreeable, and it is a principal object of
their vanity to give every possible decoration to their persons.  A
material article in their toilets is vermilion, which they contrast with
their native blue, white, and brown earths, to which charcoal is
frequently added.</p>

<p>Their dress is at once simple and commodious.  It consists of tight
leggins, reaching near the hip: a strip of cloth or leather, called
assian, about a foot wide, and five feet long, whose ends are drawn
inwards and hang behind and before, over a belt tied round the waist for
that purpose: a close vest or shirt reaching down to the former garment,
and cinctured with a broad strip of parchment fastened with thongs
behind; and a cap for the head, consisting of a piece of fur, or small
skin, with the brush of the animal as a suspended ornament: a kind of
robe is thrown occasionally over the whole of the dress, and serves both
night and day.  These articles, with the addition of shoes and mittens,
constitute the variety of their apparel.  The materials vary according
to the season, and consist of dressed moose-skin, beaver prepared with
the fur, or European woollens.  The leather is neatly painted, and
fancifully worked in some parts with porcupine quills, and moose-deer
hair: the shirts and leggins are also adorned with fringe and tassels;
nor are the shoes and mittens without somewhat of appropriate
decoration, and worked with a considerable degree of skill and taste.
These habiliments are put on, however, as fancy or convenience suggests;
and they will sometimes proceed to the chase in the severest frost,
covered only with the slightest of them.</p>

<p>
Their
head-dresses are composed of the feathers of the swan, the eagle,
and other birds.  The teeth, horns, and claws of different animals, are
also the occasional ornaments of the head and neck.  Their hair, however
arranged, is always besmeared with grease.  The making of every article
of dress is a female occupation; and the women, though by no means
inattentive to the decoration of their own persons, appear to have a
still greater degree of pride in attending to the appearance of the men,
whose faces are painted with more care than those of the women.</p>

<p>The female dress is formed of the same materials as those of the other
sex, but of a different make and arrangement.  Their shoes are commonly
plain, and their leggins gartered beneath the knee.  The coat, or body
covering, falls down to the middle of the leg, and is fastened over the
shoulders with cords, a flap or cape turning down about eight inches,
both before and behind, and agreeably ornamented with quill-work and
fringe; the bottom is also fringed, and fancifully painted as high as
the knee.  As it is very loose, it is enclosed round the waist with a
stiff belt, decorated with tassels, and fastened behind.  The arms are
covered to the wrist, with detached sleeves, which are sewed as far as
the bend of the arm; from thence they are drawn up to the neck, and the
corners of them fall down behind, as low as the waist.  The cap, when
they wear one, consists of a certain quantity of leather or cloth, sewed
at one end, by which means it is kept on the head, and, hanging down the
back, is fastened to the belt, as well as under the chin.  The upper
garment is a robe like that worn by the men.  Their hair is divided on
the crown, and tied behind, or sometimes fastened in large knots over
the ears.  They are fond of European articles, and prefer them to their
own native commodities.  Their ornaments consist in common with all
savages, in bracelets, rings, and similar baubles.  Some of the women
tattoo three perpendicular lines, which are sometimes double: one from
the centre of the chin to that of the under lip, and one parallel on
either side to the corner of the mouth.</p>

<p>Of all the nations which I have seen on this continent, the Knisteneaux
women are the most comely.  Their figure is generally well proportioned,
and the regularity of their features would be acknowledged by the more
civilized people of Europe.  Their complexion has less of that dark
tinge which is common to those savages who have less cleanly habits.</p>

<p>These people are, in general, subject to few disorders.  The lues
venera, however, is
a  common
complaint, but cured by the application of simples, with whose virtues
they appear to be well acquainted.  They are also subject to fluxes, and
pains in the breast, which some have attributed to the very keen and
cold air which they inhale; but I should imagine that these complaints
must frequently proceed from their immoderate indulgence in fat meat at
their feasts, particularly when they have been preceded by long
fasting.</p>

<p>They are naturally mild and affable, as well as just in their
dealings, not only among themselves, but with strangers.<a name="kl2" href="#kr2">[2]</a> They are also generous and hospitable, and
good-natured in the extreme, except when their nature is perverted by
the inflammatory influence of spirituous liquors.  To their children
they are indulgent to a fault.  The father, though he assumes no command
over them, is ever anxious to instruct them in all the preparatory
qualifications for war and hunting; while the mother is equally
attentive to her daughters in teaching them every thing that is
considered as necessary to their character and situation.  It does not
appear that the husband makes any distinction between the
children of
his wife, though they may be the offspring of different fathers.
Illegitimacy is only attached to those who are born before their mothers
have cohabited with any man by the title of husband.</p>

<p>It does not appear, that chastity is considered by them as a virtue; or
that fidelity is believed to be essential to the happiness of wedded
life, Though it sometimes happens that the infidelity of a wife is
punished by the husband with the loss of her hair, nose, and perhaps
life; such severity proceeds from its having been practised without his
permission: for a temporary interchange of wives is not uncommon: and
the offer of their persons is considered as a necessary part of the
hospitality due to strangers.</p>

<p>When a man loses his wife, it is considered as a duty to marry her
sister, if she has one; or he may, if he pleases, have them both at the
same time.</p>

<p>It will appear from the fatal consequences I have repeatedly imputed
to the use of spirituous liquors that I more particularly consider these
people as having been, morally speaking, great sufferers from their
communication with the subjects of civilized nations.  At the same time
they were not, in a state of nature, without their vices, and some of
them of a kind which is the most abhorrent to cultivated and reflecting
man.  I shall only

observe, that incest and bestiality are among them.</p>

<p>When a young man marries, he immediately goes to live with the father
and mother of his wife, who treat him, nevertheless, as a perfect
stranger, till after the birth of his first child: he then attaches
himself more to them than his own parents; and his wife no longer gives
him any other denomination than that of the father of her child.</p>

<p>The profession of the men is war and hunting, and the more active scene
of their duty is the field of battle, and the chase in the woods.  They
also spear fish, but the management of the nets is left to the women.
The females of this nation are in the same subordinate state with those
of all other savage tribes, but the severity of their labour is much
diminished by their situation on the banks of lakes and rivers, where
they employ canoes.  In the winter, when the waters are frozen, they
make their journeys, which are never of any great length, with sledges
drawn by dogs.  They are, at the same time, subject to every kind of
domestic drudgery; they dress the leather, make the clothes and shoes,
weave the nets, collect wood, erect the tents, fetch water, and perform
every culinary service; so that when the duties of maternal care are
added, it will appear, that the life of these women is an uninterrupted
succession of
toil and pain.  This, indeed, is the sense they entertain
of their own situation; and under the influence of that sentiment, they
are sometimes known to destroy their female children, to save them from
the miseries which they themselves have suffered.  They also have a
ready way, by the use of certain simples, of procuring abortions, which
they sometimes practise, from their hatred of the father, or to save
themselves the trouble which children occasion: and, as I have been
credibly informed, this unnatural act is repeated without any injury to
the health of the women who perpetrate it.</p>

<p>The funeral rites begin, like all other solemn ceremonials, with
smoking, and are concluded by a feast.  The body is dressed in the best
habiliments possessed by the deceased, or his relations, and is then
deposited in a grave lined with branches; some domestic utensils are
place on it, and a kind of canopy erected over it.  During this
ceremony, great lamentations are made, and if the departed person is
very much regretted, the near relations cut off their hair, pierce the
fleshy part of their thighs and arms with arrows, knives, etc, and
blacken their faces with charcoal.  If they have distinguished
themselves in war, they are sometimes laid on a kind of scaffolding; and
I have been informed, that women, as in the East, have been known to
sacrifice themselves to the manes of their husbands.  The whole of the
property belonging to the departed person is destroyed, and the
relations take in exchange for the wearing apparel, any rags that will
cover their nakedness.  The feast bestowed on the occasion, which is, or
at least used to be, repeated annually, is accompanied with eulogiums on
the deceased, and without any acts of ferocity.  On the tomb are carved
or painted the symbols of his tribe, which are taken from the different
animals of the country.</p>

<p>Many and various are the motives which induce a savage to engage in war.
To prove his courage, or to revenge the death of his relations, or some
of his tribe, by the massacre of an enemy.  If the tribe feel themselves
called upon to go to war, the elders convene the people, in order to
know the general opinion.  If it be for war, the chief publishes his
intention to smoke in the sacred stem at a certain period, to which
solemnity, meditation and fasting are required as preparatory
ceremonials.  When the people are thus assembled, and the meeting
sanctified by the custom of smoking, the chief enlarges on the causes
which have called them together, and the necessity of the measures
proposed on the occasion.  He then invites those who are willing to
follow him, to smoke out of the sacred stem, which is considered as the
token of enrolment; and if it should be the general opinion that
assistance is necessary, others are invited, with great formality, to
join them.  Every individual who attends these meetings, brings
something with him as a token of his warlike intention, or as an object
of sacrifice, which, when the assembly dissolves, is suspended from
poles near the place of council.</p>

<p>They have frequent feasts, and particular circumstances never fail to
produce them, such as a tedious illness, long fasting, etc.  On these
occasions it is usual for the person who means to give the
entertainment, to announce his design, on a certain day, of opening the
medicine-bag, and smoking out of his sacred stem.  This declaration is
considered as a sacred vow that cannot be broken.  There are also stated
periods, such as the spring and autumn, when they engage in very long
and solemn ceremonies.  On these occasions dogs are offered as
sacrifices, and those which are very fat, and milk-white, are preferred.
They also make large offerings of their property, whatever it may be.
The scene of these ceremonies is in an open inclosure on the bank of a
river or lake, and in the most conspicuous situation, in order that such
as are passing along or travelling, may be induced to make their
offerings.  There
is also a
particular custom among them, that, on these occasions, if any of the
tribe, or even a stranger, should be passing by, and be in real want of
any thing that is displayed as an offering, he has a right to take it,
so that he replaces it with some article he can spare, though it be of
far inferior value; but to take or touch any thing wantonly is
considered as a sacrilegious act, and highly insulting to the great
Master of Life, to use their own expression, who is the sacred object of
their devotion.</p>

<p>The scene of private sacrifice is the lodge of the person who
performs it, which is prepared for that purpose, by removing every thing
out of it, and spreading green branches in every part.  The fire and
ashes are also taken away.  A new hearth is made of fresh, earth, and
another fire is lighted.  The owner of the dwelling remains alone in it;
and he begins the ceremony by spreading a piece of new cloth, or a
well-dressed moose-skin neatly painted, on which he opens his
medicine-bag and exposes its contents, consisting of various articles.
The principal of them is a kind of household god, which is a small
carved image about eight inches long.  Its first covering is of down,
over which a piece of birch-bark is closely tied, and the whole is
enveloped in several folds of red and blue cloth.  This little figure is
an object of the 
most pious regard.  The next article is his war-cap, which is decorated
with the feathers and plumes of scarce birds, beavers, and eagle's
claws, etc.  There is also suspended from it a quill or feather for
every enemy whom the owner of it has slain in battle.  The remaining
contents of the bag are, a piece of Brazil tobacco, several roots and
simples, which are in great estimation for their medicinal qualities,
and a pipe.  These articles being all exposed, and the stem resting upon
two forks, as it must not touch the ground, the master of the lodge
sends for the person he most esteems, who sits down opposite to him; the
pipe is then filled and fixed to the stem.  A pair of wooden pincers is
provided to put the fire in the pipe, and a double-pointed pin, to empty
it of the remnant of tobacco which is not consumed.  This arrangement
being made, the men assemble, and sometimes the women are allowed to be
humble spectators, while the most religious awe and solemnity pervades
the whole.  The Michiniwais, or Assistant, takes up the pipe, lights it,
and presents it to the officiating person, who receives it standing and
holds it between both his hands.  He then turns himself to the East, and
draws a few whiffs, which he blows to that point.  The same ceremony he
observes to the other three quarters, with his eyes directed upwards
during the
whole of it.
He holds the stem about the middle between the three first
fingers of both hands, and raising them upon a line with his forehead,
he swings it three times round from the East, with the sun, when, after
pointing and balancing it in various directions, he reposes it on the
forks: he then makes a speech to explain the design of their being
called together, which concludes with an acknowledgment for past
mercies, and a prayer for the continuance of them, from the Master of
Life.  He then sits down, and the whole company declare their
approbation and thanks by uttering the word <i>ho!</i> with an emphatic
prolongation of the last letter.  The Michiniwais then takes up the pipe
and holds it to the mouth of the officiating person, who, after smoking
three whiffs out of it, utters a short prayer, and then goes round with
it, taking his course from East to West, to every person present, who
individually says something to him on the occasion; and thus the pipe is
generally smoked out; when, after turning it three or four times round
his head, he drops it downwards, and replaces it in its original
situation.  He then returns the company thanks for their attendance, and
wishes them, as well as the whole tribe, health and long life.</p>

<p>These smoking rites precede every matter of great importance with more
or less ceremony, but
always with equal solemnity.  The utility of them will appear from the
following relation.</p>

<p>If a chief is anxious to know the disposition of his people towards him,
or if he wishes to settle any difference between them, he announces his
intention of opening his medicine-bag and smoking in his sacred stem;
and no man who entertains a grudge against any of the party thus
assembled can smoke with the sacred stem; as that ceremony dissipates
all differences, and is never violated.</p>

<p>No one can avoid attending on these occasions; but a person may
attend and be excused from assisting at the ceremonies, by acknowledging
that he has not undergone the necessary purification.  The having
cohabited with his wife, or any other woman, within twenty-four hours
preceding the ceremony, renders him unclean, and, consequently,
disqualifies him from performing any part of it.  If a contract is
entered into and solemnised by the ceremony of smoking, it never fails
of being faithfully fulfilled.  If a person, previous to his going a
journey, leaves the sacred stem as a pledge of his return, no
consideration whatever will prevent him from executing his
engagement.<a name="kl3" href="#kr3">[3]</a></p>

<p>The chief,
when he proposes to make a feast, sends quills, or small
pieces of wood, as tokens of invitation to such as he wishes to partake
of it.  At the appointed time the guests arrive, each bringing a dish or
platter, and a knife, and take their seats on each side of the chief,
who receives them sitting, according to their respective ages.  The pipe
is then lighted, and he makes an equal division of every thing that is
provided.  While the company are enjoying their meal, the chief sings,
and accompanies his song with the tambourine, or shishiquoi, or rattle.
The guest who has first eaten his portion is considered as the most
distinguished person.  If there should be any who cannot finish the
whole of their mess, they endeavour to prevail on some of their friends
to eat it for them, who are rewarded for their assistance with
ammunition and tobacco.  It is proper also to remark, that at these
feasts a small quantity of meat or drink is sacrificed, before they
begin to eat, by throwing it into the fire, or on the earth.</p>

<p>These feasts differ according to circumstances; sometimes each man's
allowance is no more than he can despatch in a couple of hours.  At
other times the quantity is sufficient to supply each of them with food
for a week, though it must be devoured in a day.  On these occasions it
is very difficult to 
procure substitutes, and the whole must be eaten
whatever time it may require.  At some of these entertainments there is
a more rational arrangement, when the guests are allowed to carry home
with them the superfluous part of their portions.  Great care is always
taken that the bones may be burned, as it would be considered a
profanation were the dogs permitted to touch them.</p>

<p>The public feasts are conducted in the same manner, but with some
additional ceremony.  Several chiefs officiate at them, and procure the
necessary provisions, as well as prepare a proper place of reception for
the numerous company.  Here the guests discourse upon public topics,
repeat the heroic deeds of their forefathers, and excite the rising
generation to follow their example.  The entertainments on these
occasions consist of dried meats, as it would not be practicable to
dress a sufficient quantity of fresh meat for such a large assembly;
though the women and children are excluded.</p>

<p>Similar feasts used to be made at funerals, and annually, in honour of
the dead; but they have been, for some time, growing into disuse, and I
never had an opportunity of being present at any of them.</p>

<p>The women, who are forbidden to enter the places sacred to these
festivals, dance and sing around them, and sometimes beat time to the
music within them; which forms an agreeable contrast.</p>

<p>With respect to their divisions of time, they compute the length of
their journeys by the number of nights passed in performing them; and
they divide the year by the succession of moons.  In this calculation,
however, they are not altogether correct, as they cannot account for the
odd days.</p>

<p>The names which they give to the names are descriptive of the several
seasons.</p>

<p>These people know the medicinal virtues of many herbs and simples, and
apply the roots of plants and the bark of trees with success.  But the
conjurers, who monopolize the medical science, find it necessary to
blend mystery with their art, and do not communicate their knowledge.
Their materia medica they administer in the form of purges and clysters,
but the remedies and surgical operations are supposed to derive much of
their effect from magic and incantation.  When a blister rises in the
foot from the frost, the chafing of the shoe, etc., they immediately
open it, and apply the heated blade of a knife to the part, which,
painful as it may be, is found to be efficacious.  A sharp flint serves
them as a lancet for letting blood, as well as for scarification in
bruises and swellings.  For sprains, the dung of an animal just killed
is considered as the best remedy.  They are very fond of European
medicines, though they are ignorant of their application: and those
articles form an inconsiderable part of the European traffic with them.</p>

<p>Among their various superstitions, they believe that the vapour which is
seen to hover over moist and swampy places, is the spirit of some person
lately dead.  They also fancy another spirit which appears, in the shape
of a man, upon the trees near the lodge of a person deceased, whose
property has not been interred with them.  He is represented as bearing
a gun in his hand, and it is believed that he does not return to his
rest, till the property that has been withheld from the grave has been
sacrificed to it.</p>

<br/>

<h4>SOME ACCOUNT OF THE CHEPEWYAN INDIANS.</h4>

<p>They are a numerous people, who consider the country between the
parallels of latitude 60. and 65. North, and longitude 100. to
110. West, as their lands or home.  They speak a copious language, which
is very difficult to be attained, and furnishes dialects to the various
emigrant tribes which inhabit the following immense track of country,
whose boundary I shall describe.<a name="cl1" href="#cr1">[1]</a> It
begins at Churchill, and runs along the line of separation between them
and the Knisteneaux, up the Missinipi to the Isle a la Crosse, passing
on through the Buffalo Lake, River Lake, and Portage la Loche: from
thence it proceeds by the Elk River to the Lake of the Hills, and goes
directly West to the Peace River; and up that river to its source and
tributary waters; from whence it proceeds to the waters of the river
Columbia; and follows that river to latitude 52. 24. North, and
longitude 122. 54. West, where the

Chepewyans have the Atnah or Chin Nation for their neighbours.  It then
takes a line due West to the seacoast, within which, the country is
possessed by a people who speak their language<a name="cl2" href="#cr2">[2]</a> and
are consequently descended from them: there can be no doubt, therefore, of their
progress being to the Eastward.  A tribe of them is even known at the upper
establishments on the Saskatchiwine; and I do not pretend to ascertain
how far they may follow the Rocky Mountains to the East.</p>

<p>It is not possible to form any just estimate of their numbers, but it is
apparent, nevertheless, that they are by no means proportionate to the
vast extent of their territories, which may, in some degree, be
attributed to the ravages of the small-pox, which are, more or less,
evident throughout this part of the continent.</p>

<p>The notion which these people entertain of the creation, is of a very
singular nature.  They believe that, at the first, the globe was one
vast and entire ocean, inhabited by no living creature, except a mighty
bird, whose eyes were fire, whose glances were lightning, and the
clapping of whose wings were thunder.  On his descent to the ocean, and
touching it, the earth instantly arose, and remained on the surface of
the waters.  This omnipotent bird then called forth all the variety of
animals from the earth, except the Chepewyans, who were produced from a
dog; and this circumstance occasions their aversion to the flesh of that
animal, as well as the people who eat it.  This extraordinary tradition
proceeds to relate, that the great bird, having finished his work, made
an arrow, which was to be preserved with great care, and to remain
untouched; but that the Chepewyans were so devoid of understanding, as
to carry it away; and the sacrilege so enraged the great bird, that he
has never since appeared.</p>

<p>They have also a tradition amongst them, that they originally came from
another country, inhabited by very wicked people, and had traversed a
great lake, which was narrow, shallow, and full of islands, where they
had suffered great misery, it being always winter, with ice and deep
snow.  At the Copper-Mine River, where they made the first land, the
ground was covered with copper, over which a body of earth had since
been collected, to the depth of a man's height.  They believe, also,
that in ancient times their ancestors lived till their feet were worn
out with walking, and their throats with eating.  They describe a
deluge, when the waters spread over the whole earth, except the highest
mountains, on the tops of which they preserved themselves.</p>

<p>They believe, that immediately after their death, they pass into another
world, where they arrive at a large river, on which they embark in a
stone canoe, and that a gentle current bears them on to an extensive
lake, in the centre of which is a most beautiful island; and that, in
the view of this delightful abode, they receive that judgment for their
conduct during life, which terminates their final state and unalterable
allotment.  If their good actions are declared to predominate, they are
landed upon the island, where there is to be no end to-their happiness;
which, however, according to their notions, consists in an eternal
enjoyment of sensual pleasure, and carnal gratification.  But if their
bad actions weigh down the balance, the stone canoe sinks at once, and
leaves them up to their chins in the water, to behold and regret the
reward enjoyed by the good, and eternally struggling, but with
unavailing endeavours, to reach the blissful island, from which they are
excluded for ever.</p>

<p>They have some faint notions of the transmigration of the soul; so that
if a child be born with teeth, they instantly imagine, from its
premature appearance, that it bears a resemblance to some person who had
lived to an advanced period, and that he has assumed a renovated life,
with these extraordinary tokens of maturity.</p>

<p>The Chepewyans are sober, timorous, and vagrant, with a selfish
disposition that has sometimes created suspicions of their integrity.
Their stature has nothing remarkable in it; but though they are seldom
corpulent, they are sometimes robust.  Their complexion is swarthy;
their features coarse, and their hair lank, but always of a dingy black;
nor have they universally the piercing eye, which generally animates the
Indian countenance.  The women have a more agreeable aspect than the
men, but their gait is awkward, which proceeds from their being
accustomed, nine months in the year, to travel on snow-shoes and drag
sledges of a weight from two to four hundred pounds.  They are very
submissive to their husbands, who have, however, their fits of jealousy;
and, for very trifling causes, treat them with such cruelty as sometimes
to occasion their death.  They are frequently objects of traffic; and
the father possesses the right of disposing of his daughter.
<a name="cl3" href="#cr3">[3]</a> The men
in general extract their beards, though some of them are seen to prefer
a bushy black beard, to a smooth chin.  They cut their hair in various
forms, or leave it in a long, natural flow, according as their caprice
or fancy suggests.  The women always wear it in great length, and some
of them are very attentive to its arrangement.  If they at any time
appear despoiled of their tresses, it is to be esteemed a proof of the
husband's jealousy, and is considered as a severer punishment than
manual correction.  Both sexes have blue or black bars, or from one to
four straight lines on their cheeks or forehead, to distinguish the
tribe to which they belong.  These marks are either tattooed, or made by
drawing a thread, dipped in the necessary colour, beneath the skin.</p>

<p>There are no people more attentive to the comforts of their dress, or
less anxious respecting its exterior appearance.  In the winter it is
composed of the skins of deer, and their fawns, and dressed as fine as
any chamois leather, in the hair.  In the summer their apparel is the
same, except that it is prepared without the hair.  Their shoes and
leggins are sewed together, the latter reaching upwards to the middle,
and being supported by a belt, under which a small piece of leather is
drawn to cover the private parts, the ends of which fall down both
before and behind.  In the shoes they put the hair of the moose or
reindeer with additional pieces of leather as socks.  The shirt or coat,
when girted round the waist, reaches to the middle of the thigh, and the
mittens are sewed to the sleeves, or are suspended by strings from the
shoulders.  A ruff or tippet surrounds the neck, and the skin of the
head of the deer forms a curious kind of cap.  A robe, made of several
deer or fawn skins sewed together, covers the whole.  This dress is worn
single or double, but always in the winter, with the hair within and
without.  Thus arrayed a Chepewyan will lay himself down on the ice in
the middle of a lake, and repose in comfort; though he will sometimes
find a difficulty in the morning to disencumber himself from the snow
drifted on him during the night.  If in his passage he should be in want
of provision, he cuts a hole in the ice, when he seldom fails of taking
some trout or pike, whose eyes he instantly scoops out, and eats as a
great delicacy; but if they should not be sufficient to satisfy his
appetite, he will, in this necessity make his meal of the fish in its
raw state; but, those whom I saw, preferred to dress their victuals when
circumstances admitted the necessary preparation.  When they are in that
part of their country which does not produce a sufficient quantity of
wood for fuel, they are reduced to the same exigency, though they
generally dry their meat in the sun.<a name="cl4" href="#cr4">[4]</a></p>

<p>The
dress of the women differs from that of the men.  Their leggins are
tied below the knee; and their coat or shift is wide, hanging down to
the ankle, and is tucked up at pleasure by means of a belt, which is
fastened round the waist.  Those who have children have these garments
made very full about the shoulders, as when they are travelling they
carry their infants upon their backs, next their skin, in which
situation they are perfectly comfortable and in a position convenient to
be suckled.  Nor do they discontinue to give their milk to them till
they have another child.  Childbirth is not the object of that tender
care and serious attention among the savages as it is among civilized
people.  At this period no part of their usual occupation is omitted,
and this continual and regular exercise must contribute to the welfare
of the mother, both in the progress of parturition and in the moment of
delivery.  The women have a singular custom of cutting off a small piece
of the navel string of the new-born children, and hang it about their
necks: they are also curious in the covering they make for it, which
they decorate with porcupine's quills and beads.</p>

<p>Though the women are as much in the power of the men, as other articles
of their property, they are always consulted, and possess a very
considerable influence in the traffic with Europeans, and other
important concerns.</p>

<p>Plurality of wives is common among them, and the ceremony of marriage is
of a very simple nature.  The girls are betrothed at a very early period
to those whom the parents think the best able to support them: nor is
the inclination of the women considered.  Whenever a separation takes
place, which sometimes happens, it depends entirely on the will and
pleasure of the husband.  In common with the other Indians of this
country, they
have a custom respecting the periodical state of a woman,
which is rigorously observed: at that time she must seclude herself from
society.  They are not even allowed in that situation to keep the same
path as the men, when travelling: and it is considered a great breach of
decency for a woman so circumstanced to touch any utensils of manly
occupation.  Such a circumstance is supposed to defile them, so that
their subsequent use would be followed by certain mischief or
misfortune.  There are particular skins which the women never touch, as
of the bear and wolf; and those animals the men are seldom known to
kill.</p>

<p>They are not remarkable for their activity as hunters, which is owing to
the ease with which they snare deer and spear fish: and these
occupations are not beyond the strength of their old men, women, and
boys: so that they participate in those laborious occupations, which
among their neighbours are confined to the women.  They make war on the
Esquimaux, who cannot resist their superior numbers, and put them to
death, as it is a principle with them never to make prisoners.  At the
same time they tamely submit to the Knisteneaux, who are not so numerous
as themselves, when they treat them as enemies.</p>

<p>They do not affect that cold reserve at meeting, either among themselves
or strangers,
which is common with the Knisteneaux, but communicate
mutually, and at once, all the information of which they are possessed.
Nor are they roused like them from an apparent torpor to a state of
great activity.  They are consequently more uniform in this respect,
though they are of a very persevering disposition when their interest is
concerned.</p>

<p>As these people are not addicted to spirituous liquors, they have a
regular and uninterrupted use of their understanding, which is always
directed to the advancement of their own interest; and this disposition,
as may be readily imagined, sometimes occasions them to be charged with
fraudulent habits.  They will submit with patience to the severest
treatment, when they are conscious that they deserve it, but will never
forget or forgive any wanton or unnecessary rigour.  A moderate conduct
I never found to fail, nor do I hesitate to represent them, altogether,
as the most peaceable tribe of Indians known in North America.</p>

<p>There are conjurers and high-priests, but I was not present at any of
their ceremonies; though they certainly operate in an extraordinary
manner on the imaginations of the people in the cure of disorders.
Their principal maladies are, rheumatic pains, the flux and consumption.
The venereal complaint is
 very
common; but though its progress is slow, it gradually undermines the
constitution, and brings on premature decay.  They have recourse to
superstition for their cure, and charms are their only remedies, except
the bark of the willow, which being burned and reduced to powder, is
strewed upon green wounds and ulcers, and places contrived for promoting
perspiration.  Of the use of simples and plants they have no knowledge;
nor can it be expected, as their country does not produce them.</p>

<p>Though they have enjoyed so long an intercourse with Europeans, their
country is so barren, as not to be capable of producing the ordinary
necessaries naturally introduced by such a communication and they
continue, in a great measure, their own inconvenient and awkward modes
of taking their game and preparing it when taken.  Sometimes they drive
the deer into the small lakes, where they spear them, or force them into
inclosures, where the bow and arrow are employed against them.  These
animals are also taken in snares made of skin.  In the former instance
the game is divided among those who have been engaged in the pursuit of
it.  In the latter it is considered as private property; nevertheless,
any unsuccessful hunter passing by, may take a deer so caught, leaving
the head, skin, and saddle for the owner.
Thus,
though they have no regular government, as every man is lord in his own
family, they are influenced, more or less, by certain principles which
condone to their general benefit.</p>

<p>In their quarrels with each other, they very rarely proceed to a
greater degree of violence than is occasioned by blows, wrestling, and
pulling of the hair, while their abusive language consists in applying
the name of the most offensive animal to the object of their
displeasure, and adding the term ugly, and chiay, or
still-born.<a name="cl5" href="#cr5">[5]</a></p>

<p>Their arms and domestic apparatus, in addition to the articles procured
from Europeans, are spears, bows, and arrows, fishing nets, and lines
made of green deer-skin thongs.  They have also nets for taking the
beaver as he endeavours to escape from his lodge when it is broken open.
It is set in a particular manner for the purpose, and a man is employed
to watch the moment when he enters the snare, or he would soon cut his
way through it.  He is then thrown upon the ice where he remains as if
he had no life in him.</p>

<p>The snow-shoes are of a very superior workmanship.  The inner part of
their frame is straight, the outer one is curved, and it is pointed at
both ends, with that in front turned up.  They are also laced with great
neatness with thongs made of deer-skin.  The sledges are formed of thin
slips of board turned up also in front, and are highly polished with
crooked knives, in order to slide along with facility.  Close-grained
wood is, on that account, the best; but theirs are made of the red or
swamp spruce-fir tree.</p>

<p>The country, which these people claim as their land, has a very small
quantity of earth, and produces little or no wood or herbage.  Its chief
vegetable substance is the moss, on which the deer feed; and a kind of
rock moss, which, in times of scarcity, preserves the lives of the
natives.  When boiled in water, it dissolves into a clammy, glutinous
substance, that affords a very sufficient nourishment.  But,
notwithstanding the barren state of their country, with proper care and
economy, these people might live in great comfort, for the lakes abound
in fish, and the hills are covered with deer.  Though, of all the Indian
people of this continent they are considered as the most provident, they
suffer severely at certain seasons, and particularly in the dead of
winter, when they are under the necessity of retiring to their scanty,
stinted woods.  To the Westward of them the musk-ox may be found, but
they have no dependence on it as an article of sustenance.
 There are
also large hares, a few white wolves, peculiar to their country, and
several kinds of foxes, with white and grey partridges, etc.  The beaver
and moose-deer they do not find till they come within 60 degrees North
latitude; and the buffalo is still further South.  That animal is known
to frequent an higher latitude to the Westward of their country.  These
people bring pieces of beautiful variegated marble, which are found on
the surface of the earth.  It is easily worked, bears a fine polish, and
hardens with time; it endures heat, and is manufactured into pipes or
calumets, as they are very fond of smoking tobacco; a luxury which the
Europeans communicated to them.</p>

<p>Their amusements or recreations are but few.  Their music is so
inharmonious, and their dancing so awkward, that they might be supposed
to be ashamed of both, as they very seldom practise either.  They also
shoot at marks, and play at the games common among them; but in fact
they prefer sleeping to either; and the greater part of their time is
passed in procuring food, and resting from the toil necessary to obtain
it.  They are also of a querulous disposition, and are continually
making complaints; which they express by a constant repetition of the
word eduiy, "it is hard," in a whining and plaintive tone of voice.</p>

<p>

They are superstitious in the extreme, and almost every action of their
lives, however trivial, is more or less influenced by some whimsical
notion.  I never observed that they had any particular form of religious
worship; but as they believe in a good and evil spirit, and a state of
future rewards and punishments, they cannot be devoid of religious
impressions.  At the same time they manifest a decided unwillingness to
make any communications on the subject.</p>

<p>The Chepewyans have been accused of abandoning their aged and infirm
people to perish, and of not burying their dead; but these are
melancholy necessities, which proceed from their wandering way of life.
They are by no means universal, for it is within my knowledge, that a
man, rendered helpless by the palsy, was carried about for many years,
with the greatest tenderness and attention, till he died a natural
death.  That they should not bury their dead in their own country,
cannot be imputed to them as a custom arising from a savage
insensibility, as they inhabit such high latitudes that the ground never
thaws; but it is well known, that when they are in the woods, they cover
their dead with trees.  Besides, they manifest no common respect to the
memory of their departed friends, by a long period of mourning, cutting
off their hair, and never making use
of the
property of the deceased.  Nay, they frequently destroy or sacrifice
their own, as a token of regret and sorrow.</p>

<p>If there be any people who, from the barren state of their country,
might be supposed to be cannibals by nature, these people, from the
difficulty they, at times, experience in procuring food, might be liable
to that imputation.  But, in all my knowledge of them, I never was
acquainted with one instance of that disposition; nor among all the
natives which I met with in a route of five thousand miles, did I see or
hear of an example of cannibalism, but such as arose from that
irresistible necessity, which has been known to impel even the most
civilized people to eat each other.</p>

that of the rump, which is much thicker in these wild than our domestic
animals, is melted down and mixed, in a boiling state with the pounded
meat, in equal proportions: it is then put in baskets or bags for the
convenience of carrying it.  Thus it becomes a nutritious food, and is
eaten, without any further preparation, or the addition of spice, salt,
or any vegetable or farinaceous substance.  A little time reconciles it
to the palate.  There is another sort made with the addition of marrow
and dried berries, which is of a superior quality.</p>

<h2>JOURNAL OF A VOYAGE, &amp;c.</h2>
<br/><br/>
<h4><a name="chapter1" href="#toc_chapter1"> CHAPTER I.</a></h4>

<p class="noindent">JUNE, 1789.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, 3.</i>—We embarked at nine in the morning, at
Fort Chepewyan, on the South side of the Lake of the Hills, in latitude
58. 40. North, and longitude 110. 30. West from Greenwich, and compass
has sixteen degrees variation East, in a canoe made of birch bark.  The
crew consisted of four Canadians, two of whom were attended by their
wives, and a German; we were accompanied also by an Indian, who had
acquired the title of English Chief, and his two wives, in a small
canoe, with two young Indians; his followers in another small canoe.
These men were engaged to serve us in the twofold capacity of
interpreters and hunters.  This chief has been a principal leader of his
countrymen who were in the habit of carrying furs to Churchill Factory,
Hudson's Bay, and till of late very much attached to the interest of
that company.  These circumstances procured him the appellation of the
English Chief.</p>

<p>
We were also accompanied by a canoe that I had equipped for the purpose
of trade, and given the charge of it to M. Le Roux, one of the Company's
clerks.  In this I was obliged to ship part of our provision; which,
with the clothing necessary for us on the voyage, a proper assortment of
the articles of merchandise as presents, to ensure us a friendly
reception among the Indians, and the ammunition and arms requisite for
defence, as well as a supply for our hunters, were more than our own
canoe could carry, but by the time we should part company, there was
every reason to suppose that our expenditure would make sufficient room
for the whole.</p>

<p>We proceeded twenty-one miles to the West, and then took a course of
nine miles to North-North-West, when we entered the river, or one of the
branches of the lake, of which there are several.  We then steered North
five miles, when our course changed for two miles to North-North-East,
and here at seven in the evening we landed and pitched our tents.  One
of the hunters killed a goose, and a couple of ducks: at the same time
the canoe was taken out of the water, to be gummed, which necessary
business was effectually performed.</p>

<br/><p><i>Thursday, 4.</i>—We embarked at four this morning, and
proceeded North-North-East half a mile, North one mile and a half,
West two miles,
North-West two miles, West-North-West one mile and a half,
North-North-West half a mile, and West-North-West two miles, when this
branch loses itself in the Peace River.  It is remarkable, that the
currents of these various branches of the lake, when the Peace River is
high, as in May and August, run into the lake, which, in the other
months of the year returns its waters to them; whence, to this place,
the branch is not more than two hundred yards wide, nor less than an
hundred and twenty.  The banks are rather low, except in one place,
where an huge rock rises above them, The low land is covered with wood,
such as white birch, pines of different kinds, with the poplar, three
kinds of willow, and the liard.</p>

<p>The Peace River is upwards of a mile broad at this spot, and its
current is stronger than that of the channel which communicates with the
lake. It here, indeed, assumes the name of the Slave River.
<a name="chap1-l1" href="#chap1-r1">[1]</a> The course of this day was
as follows:—North-West two miles, North-North-West, through
islands, six miles, North four miles and a half, North by East
two
miles, West by North six miles, North one mile, North-East by East
two miles, North one mile.  We now descended a rapid, and proceeded
North-West seven miles and a half, North-West nine miles, North by West
six miles, North-West by West one mile and a half, North-West by North
half a mile, North-North-West six miles, North one mile, North-West by
West four miles, North-North-East one mile.  Here we arrived at the
mouth of the Dog River, where we landed, and unloaded our canoes, at
half past seven in the evening, on the East side, and close by the
rapids.  At this station the river is near two leagues in breadth.</p>

<br/><p><i>Friday, 5.</i>—At three o'clock in the morning we
embarked, but unloaded our canoes at the first rapid.  When we had
reloaded, we entered a small channel, which is formed by the islands,
and, in about half an hour, we came to the carrying-place It is three
hundred and eighty paces in length, and very commodious, except at the
further end of it.  We found some difficulty in reloading at this spot,
from the large quantity of ice which had not yet thawed.  From hence to
the next carrying-place, called the <i>Portage d'Embarras</i>, is about
six miles, and is occasioned by the drift wood filling up the small
channel, which is one thousand and twenty paces in length; from hence to
the next is one
mile  and a half,
while the distance to that which succeeds, does not exceed one hundred
and fifty yards.  It is about the same length as the last; and from
hence to the carrying-place called the Mountain, is about four miles
further; when we entered the great river.  The smaller one, or the
channel, affords by far the best passage, as it is without hazard of any
kind; though I believe a shorter course would be found on the outside of
the islands, and without so many carrying-places.  That called the
Mountain is three hundred and thirty-five paces in length; from thence
to the next, named the Pelican, there is about a mile of dangerous
rapids.  The landing is very steep, and close to the fall.  The length
of this carrying-place is eight hundred and twenty paces.</p>

<p>The whole of the party were now employed in taking the baggage and the
canoe up the hill.  One of the Indian canoes went down the fall, and was
dashed to pieces.  The woman who had the management of it, by quitting
it in time, preserved her life, though she lost the little property it
contained.</p>

<p>The course from the place we quitted in the morning is about North-West,
and comprehends a distance of fifteen miles.  From hence to the next and
last carrying-place, is about nine miles; in which distance there are
three rapids: course North-West by West.  The carrying path is very bad,
and five hundred and thirty-five paces in length.  Our canoes being
lightened, passed on the outside of the opposite island, which rendered
the carrying of the baggage very short indeed, being not more than the
length of a canoe.  In the year 1786, five men were drowned, and two
canoes and some packages lost, in the rapids on the other side of the
river, which occasioned this place to be called the <i>Portage des Noyes</i>.
They were proceeding to the Slave Lake, in the fall of that year, under
the direction of Mr. Cuthbert Grant.  We proceeded from hence six miles,
and encamped on Point de Roche, at half past five in the afternoon.  The
men and Indians were very much fatigued; but the hunters had provided
seven geese, a beaver, and four ducks.</p>

<br/><p><i>Saturday, 6.</i>—We embarked at half past two in the
morning, and steered North-West by North twenty-one miles, North-West by
West five miles, West-North-West four miles, West six miles, doubled a
point North-North-East one mile, East five miles, North two miles,
North-West by North one mile and a half, West-North-West three miles,
North-East by East two miles; doubled a point one mile and a half, West
by North nine miles, North-West by West six miles, North-North-West five
miles; here we landed at six o'clock in the evening, unloaded,
and encamped.
Nets were also set in a small adjacent river.  We had an head wind
during the greater part of the day and the weather was become so cold
that the Indians were obliged to make use of their mittens.  In this
day's progress we killed seven geese and six ducks.</p>

<br/><p><i>Sunday, 7.</i>—At half past three we renewed our voyage,
and proceeded West-North-West one mile, round an island one mile,
North-West two miles and a half, South by West three miles,
West-South-West one mile, South-West by South half a mile, North-West
three miles, West-North-West three miles and a half, North seven miles
and a half, North-West by North four miles, North two miles and a half,
North-West by North two miles.  The rain, which had prevailed for some
time, now came on with such violence, that we were obliged to land and
unload, to prevent the goods and baggage from getting wet; the weather,
however, soon cleared up, so that we reloaded the canoe, and got under
way.  We now continued our course North ten miles, West one mile and a
half, and North one mile and a half, when the rain came on again, and
rendered it absolutely necessary for us to get on shore for the night,
at about half past three.  We had a strong North-North-East wind
throughout the day, which greatly impeded
us;  M. Le Roux,
however, with his party, passed on in search of a landing place more
agreeable to them.  The Indians killed a couple of geese, and as many
ducks.  The rain continued through the remaining part of the day.</p>

<br/><p><i>Monday, 8.</i>—The night was very boisterous, and the
rain did not cease till two in the afternoon of this day; but as the
wind did not abate of its violence, we were prevented from proceeding
till the morrow.</p>

<br/><p><i>Tuesday, 9.</i>—We embarked at half past two in the
morning, the weather being calm and foggy.  Soon after our two young men
joined us, whom we had not seen for two days; but during their absence
they had killed four beavers and ten geese.  After a course of one mile
North-West by North, we observed an opening on the right, which we took
for a fork of the river, but it proved to be a lake.  We returned and
steered South-West by West one mile and a half, West-South-West one mile
and a half, West one mile, when we entered a very small branch of the
river on the East bank; at the mouth of which I was informed there had
been a carrying-place, owing to the quantity of drift wood, which then
filled up the passage, but has since been carried away.  The course of
this river is meandering, and tends to the North, and in about ten miles
falls into the Slave Lake, where we arrived at nine in the morning, when we found a great
change in the weather, as it was become extremely cold.  The lake was
entirely covered with ice, and did not seem in any degree to have given
way, but near the shore.  The gnats and mosquitoes, which were very
troublesome during our passage along the river, did not venture to
accompany us to this colder region.</p>

<p>The banks of the river both above and below the rapids, were on both
sides covered with the various kinds of wood common to this country,
particularly the Western side; the land being lower and consisting of a
rich black soil.  This artificial ground is carried down by the stream,
and rests upon drift wood, so as to be eight or ten feet deep.  The
eastern banks are more elevated, and the soil a yellow clay mixed with
gravel; so that the trees are neither so large or numerous as on the
opposite shore.  The ground was not thawed above fourteen inches in
depth; notwithstanding the leaf was at its full growth; while along the
lake there was scarcely any appearance of verdure.</p>

<p>The Indians informed me, that, at a very small distance from either bank
of the river, are very extensive plains, frequented by large herds of
buffaloes; while the moose and rein-deer keep in the woods that border
on it.  The beavers, which are in great numbers, build their habitations
in the small lakes and 
rivers, as, in the larger streams, the ice
carries every thing along with it, during the spring.  The mud-banks in
the river are covered with wild fowl; and we this morning killed two
swans, ten geese, and one beaver, without suffering the delay of an
hour; so that we might have soon filled the canoe with them, if that had
been our object.</p>

<p>From the small river we steered East, along the inside of a long
sand-bank, covered with drift wood and enlivened by a few willows, which
stretches on as far as the houses erected by Messrs. Grant and Le Roux,
in 1786.  We often ran aground, as for five successive miles the depth
of the water nowhere exceeded three feet.  There we found our people,
who had arrived early in the morning, and whom we had not seen since the
preceding Sunday.  We now unloaded the canoe, and pitched our tents, as
there was every appearance that we should be obliged to remain here for
some time.  I then ordered the nets to be set, as it was absolutely
necessary that the stores provided for our future voyage should remain
untouched.  The fish we now caught were carp, poisson inconnu, white
fish, and trout.
</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, 10.</i>—It rained during the greatest part of the
preceding night, and the weather did not clear up till the afternoon of
this day.  This circumstance had very much

weakened the ice, and I sent two of the
Indians on an hunting party to a lake at the distance of nine miles,
which, they informed me, was frequented by animals of various kinds.
Our fishery this day was not so abundant as it had been on the preceding
afternoon.
</p>

<p><i>Thursday, 11.</i>—The weather was fine and clear with a
strong westerly wind.  The women were employed in gathering berries of
different sorts, of which there are a great plenty; and I accompanied
one of my people to a small adjacent island, where we picked up some
dozens of swan, geese, and duck-eggs; we also killed a couple of ducks
and a goose.</p>

<p>In the evening the Indians returned, without having seen any of the
larger animals.  A swan and a grey crane were the only fruits of their
expedition.  We caught no other fish but a small quantity of pike, which
is too common to be a favourite food with the people of the country, The
ice moved a little to the eastward.</p>

<br/><p><i>Friday, 12.</i>—The weather continued the same as yesterday, and the
mosquitoes began to visit us in great numbers.  The ice moved again in
the same direction, and I ascended an hill, but could not perceive that
it was broken in the middle of the lake.  The hunters killed a goose and
three ducks.</p>

<br/><p>
<i>Saturday,
13.</i>—The weather was cloudy, and the wind changeable till about
sunset, when it settled in the North.  It drove back the ice which was
now very much broken along the shore, and covered our nets.  One of the
hunters who had been at the Slave River the preceding evening, returned
with three beavers and fourteen geese.  He was accompanied by three
families of Indians, who left Athabasca the same day as myself: they did
not bring me any fowl; and they pleaded in excuse, that they had
travelled with so much expedition, as to prevent them from procuring
sufficient provisions for themselves.  By a meridian line, I found the
variation of the compass to be about twenty degrees East.</p>

<br/><p><i>Sunday, 14.</i>—The weather was clear and the wind
remained in the same quarter.  The ice was much broken, and driven to
the side of the lake, so that we were apprehensive for the loss of our
nets, as they could not, at present, be extricated.  At sunset there was
an appearance of a violent gust of wind from the southward, as the sky
became on a sudden, in that quarter, of a very dusky blue colour, and
the lightning was very frequent.  But instead of wind there came on a
very heavy rain, which promised to diminish the quantity of broken
ice.</p>

<br/><p><i>Monday, 15.</i>—In the morning, the bay still continued to be so full
of ice, that we could not get at our nets.  About noon, the wind veered
to the Westward, and not only uncovered the nets, but cleared a passage
to the opposite islands.  When we raised the nets we found them very
much shattered, and but few fish taken.  We now struck our tents, and
embarked at sunset, when we made the traverse, which was about eight
miles North-East by North, in about two hours.  At half-past eleven
P. M. we landed on a small island and proceeded to gum the canoe.  At
this time the atmosphere was sufficiently clear to admit of reading or
writing without the aid of artificial light.  We had not seen a star
since the second day after we left Athabasca.  About twelve o'clock, the
moon made its appearance above the tops of the trees, the lower horn
being in a state of eclipse, which continued for about six minutes, in a
cloudless sky.</p>

<p>I took soundings three times in the course of the traverse, when I found
six fathoms water, with a muddy bottom.</p>

<br/><p><i>Tuesday, 16.</i>—We were prevented from embarking this
morning by a very strong wind from the North, and the vast quantity of
floating ice.  Some trout were caught with the hook and line, but the
net was not so successful.  I had an observation which gave
61. 28. North latitude.</p>

<p>The wind becoming
moderate, we embarked about one, taking a North-West
course, through islands of ten miles, in which we took in a considerable
quantity of water.  After making several traverses, we landed at five
P. M., and having pitched our tents, the hooks, lines, and nets were
immediately set.  During the course of the day there was occasional
thunder.</p>

<br/><p><i>Wednesday, 17.</i>—We proceeded, and taking up our nets
as we passed, we found no more than seventeen fish, and were stopped
within a mile by the ice.  The Indians, however, brought us back to a
point where our fishery was very successful.  They proceeded also on a
hunting party, as well as to discover a passage among the islands; but
at three in the afternoon they returned without having succeeded in
either object.  We were, however, in expectation, that, as the wind blew
very strong, it would force a passage.  About sunset, the weather became
overcast, with thunder, lightning, and rain.</p>

<br/><p><i>Thursday, 18.</i>—The nets were taken up at four this
morning with abundance of fish, and we steered North-West four miles,
where the ice again prevented our progress.  A South-East wind drove it
among the islands, in such a manner as to impede our passage, and we
could perceive at some distance ahead, that it was but little broken.  We now set our
nets in four fathom water.  Two of our hunters had killed a rein-deer
and its fawn.  They had met with two Indian families, and in the
evening, a man belonging to one of them, paid us a visit; he informed
me, that the ice had not, stirred on the side of the island opposite to
us.  These people live entirely on fish, and were waiting to cross the
lake as soon as it should be clear of ice.</p>

<br/><p><i>Friday, 19.</i>—This morning our nets were unproductive,
as they yielded us no more than six fish, which were of a very bad kind.
In the forenoon, the Indians proceeded to the large island opposite to
us, in search of game.  The weather was cloudy, and the wind changeable;
at the same time, we were pestered by mosquitoes, though, in a great
measure, surrounded with ice.</p>

<br/><p><i>Saturday, 20.</i>—We took up our nets, but without any
fish.  It rained very hard during the night and this morning:
nevertheless, M. Le Roux and his people went back to the point which we
had quitted on the 18th, but I did not think it prudent to move.  As I
was watching for a passage through the ice, I promised to send for them
when I could obtain it.  It rained at intervals till about five o'clock;
when we loaded our canoe, and steered for the large island, West six
miles.  When we
came to the point of it, we found a great quantity of ice; we, however,
set our nets, and soon caught plenty of fish.  In our way thither we met
our hunters, but they had taken nothing.  I took soundings at an hundred
yards from the island, when we were in twenty-one fathom water.  Here we
found abundance of cranberries and small spring onions.  I now
despatched two men for M.  Le Roux, and his people.</p>

<br/><p><i>Sunday, 21.</i>—A Southerly wind blew through the night,
and drove the ice to the Northward.  The two men whom I had sent to
M. Le Roux, returned at eight this morning; they parted with him at a
small distance from us, but the wind blew so hard, that he was obliged
to put to shore.  Having a glimpse of the sun, when it was twelve by my
watch, I found the latitude 61. 34. North latitude. At two in the
afternoon, M. Le Roux and his people arrived.  At five, the ice being
almost all driven past to the Northward, we accordingly embarked, and
steered West fifteen miles, through much broken ice, and on the outside
of the islands, though it appeared to be very solid to the North-East.
I sounded three times in this distance, and found it seventy-five,
forty-four, and sixty fathom water.  We pitched our tents on one of a
cluster of small islands that were within three miles of the main
land, which we
could not reach in consequence of the ice.</p>

<p>We saw some rein-deer on one of these islands, and our hunters went in
pursuit of them, when they killed five large and two small ones, which
was easily accomplished, as the animals had no shelter to which they
could run for protection.  They had, without doubt, crossed the ice to
this spot, and the thaw coming on had detained them there, and made them
an easy prey to the pursuer.  This island was accordingly named Isle de
Carreboeuf.</p>

<p>I sat up the whole of this night to observe the setting and rising of
the sun.  That orb was beneath the horizon four hours twenty-two
minutes, and rose North 20. East by compass.  It, however, froze so
hard, that, during the sun's disappearance, the water was covered with
ice half a quarter of an inch thick.</p>

<br/><p><i>Monday, 22.</i>—We embarked at half past three in the
morning, and rounding the outside of the islands, steered North-West
thirteen miles along the ice, edging in for the main land, the wind
West, then West two miles; but it blew so hard as to oblige us to land
on an island at half past nine, from whence we could just distinguish
land to the South-East, at the distance of about twelve leagues; though
we could not determine
 whether
it was a continuation of the islands, or the shores of the
lake.<a name="chap1-l2" href="#chap1-r2">[2]</a> I took an observation at
noon, which gave me 61. 53. North, the variation of the compass being, at
the same time, about two points. M. Le Roux's people having provided two bags
of <i>pemmican</i>.<a name="chap1-l3" href="#chap1-r3">[3]</a> to be left in
the island against their return; it was called <i>Isle a la Cache</i>.</p>

<p>The wind being moderated, we proceeded again at half past two in the
afternoon, and steering West by North among the islands, made as course
of eighteen miles.  We encamped at eight o'clock on a small island, and
since eight in the morning had not passed any ice.  Though the weather
was far from being warm, we were tormented, and our rest interrupted, by
the host of mosquitoes that accompanied us.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="chap1-r1" href="#chap1-l1">[1]</a> The

enemies, the Knisteneaux, along the borders of this part of the river,

denoted more than common savageness.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="chap1-r2" href="#chap1-l2">[2]</a>

<h4> <a name="chapter2" href="#toc_chapter2"> CHAPTER II.</a></h4>

<p class="noindent">JUNE, 1789.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, 23.</i>—Towards morning, the Indians who had not
been able to keep up with us the preceding day, now joined us, and
brought two swans and a goose.  At half past three we re-embarked, and
steering West by North a mile and and half, with a Northerly wind, we
came to the foot of a traverse across a deep bay, West five miles, which
receives a considerable river at the bottom of it; the distance about
twelve miles.  The North-West side of the bay was covered with many
small islands that were surrounded with ice; but the wind driving it a
little off the land, we had a clear passage on the inside of them.  We
steered South-West nine miles under sail, then North-West nearly,
through the islands, forming a course of sixteen miles.  We landed on
the main land at half past two in the afternoon at three lodges of
Red-Knife Indians, so called from their copper knives.  They informed
us, that there were many more lodges of their friends at no great
distance; and one of the Indians set off to fetch them: they also said,
that we should see no more of them at present; as the Slave and
Beaver Indians, as
well as others of the tribe, would not be here till the time that the
swans cast their feathers.  In the afternoon it rained a torrent.</p>

<br/><p><i>Wednesday, 24.</i>—M. Le Roux purchased of these Indians
upwards of eight packs of good beaver and marten skins; and there were
not above twelve of them qualified to kill beaver.  The English chief
got upwards of an hundred skins on the score of debts due to him, of
which he had many outstanding in this country.  Forty of them he gave on
account of debts due by him since the winters of 1786 and 1787, at the
Slave Lake; the rest he exchanged for rum and other necessary articles;
and I added a small quantity of that liquor as an encouraging present to
him and his young men.  I had several consultations with these Copper
Indian people, but could obtain no information that was material to our
expedition; nor were they acquainted with any part of the river, which
was the object of my research, but the mouth of it.  In order to save as
much time as possible in circumnavigating the bays, I engaged one of the
Indians to conduct us; and I accordingly equipped him with various
articles of clothing, etc.  I also purchased a large new canoe, that he
might embark with the two young Indians in my service.</p>

<p>This day, at noon, I took an observation, which gave me 62. 24. North latitude; the variation
of the compass being about twenty-six or twenty-seven degrees to the East.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I assembled the Indians, in order to inform them that I
should take my departure on the following day; but that people would
remain on the spot till their countrymen, whom they had mentioned,
should arrive; and that, if they brought a sufficient quantity of skins
to make it answer, the Canadians would return for more goods, with a
view to winter here, and build a fort,<a name="chap2-l1" href="#chap2-r1">[1]</a> which would be continued as
long as they should be found to deserve it.  They assured me that it
would be a great encouragement to them to have a settlement of ours in
their country; and that they should exert themselves to the utmost to
kill beaver, as they would then be certain of getting an adequate value
for them.  Hitherto, they said, the Chepewyans always pillaged them; or,
at most, gave little or nothing for the fruits of their labour, which
had greatly discouraged them; and that, in consequence of this
treatment, they had no motive to pursue the beaver, but to obtain a
sufficient quantity of food and raiment.</p>

<p>I now wrote to Messrs. Macleod and Mackenzie, and addressed my papers to the former,
at Athabasca.</p>

<br/><p><i>Thursday, 25.</i>—We left this place at three this
morning, our canoe being deeply laden, as we had embarked some packages
that had come in the canoes of M. Le Roux.  We were saluted on our
departure with some volleys of small arms, which we returned, and
steered South by West straight across the bay, which is here no more
than two miles and a half broad, but, from the accounts of the natives,
it is fifteen leagues in depth, with a much greater breadth in several
parts, and full of islands.  I sounded in the course of the traverse and
found six fathoms with a sandy bottom.  Here, the land has a very
different appearance from that on which we have been since we entered
the lake.  Till we arrived here there was one continued view of high
hills and islands of solid rock, whose surface was occasionally
enlivened with moss, shrubs, and a few scattered trees, of a very
stinted growth, from an insufficiency of soil to nourish them.  But,
notwithstanding their barren appearance, almost every part of them
produces berries of various kinds, such as cranberries, juniper berries,
raspberries, partridge berries, gooseberries, and the pathegomenan,
which is something like a raspberry; it grows on a small stalk about a
foot and a half high, in wet, mossy spots.  These
fruits  are in
great abundance, though they are not to be found in the same places, but
in situations and aspects suited to their peculiar natures.</p>

<p>The land which borders the lake in this part is loose and sandy, but is
well covered with wood, composed of trees of a larger growth: it
gradually rises from the shore, and at some distance forms a ridge of
high land running along the coast, thick with wood and a rocky summit
rising above it.</p>

<p>We steered South-South-East nine miles, when we were very much
interrupted by drifting ice, and with some difficulty reached an island,
where we landed at seven.  I immediately proceeded to the further part
of it, in order to discover if there was any probability of our being
able to get from thence in the course of the day.  It is about five
miles in circumference, and I was very much surprised to find that the
greater part of the wood with which it was formerly covered, had been
cut down within twelve or fifteen years, and that the remaining stumps
were become altogether rotten.  On making inquiry concerning the cause
of this extraordinary circumstance, the English chief informed me, that
several winters ago, many of the Slave Indians inhabited the islands
that were scattered over the bay, as the surrounding waters abound with
fish throughout the 
year, but that they had been driven away by the
Knisteneaux, who continually made war upon them.  If an establishment is
to be made in this country, it must be in the neighbourhood of this
place, on account of the wood and fishery.</p>

<p>At eleven we ventured to re-embark, as the wind had driven the greatest
part of the ice past the island, though we still had to encounter some
broken pieces of it, which threatened to damage our canoe.  We steered
South-East from point to point across five bays, twenty-one miles.  We
took soundings several times, and found from six to ten fathom water.  I
observed that the country gradually descended inland, and was still
better covered with wood than in the higher parts.—Wherever we
approached the land, we perceived deserted lodges, The hunters killed
two swans and a beaver; and at length we landed at eight o'clock in the
evening, when we unloaded and gummed our canoe.</p>

<br/><p><i>Friday, 26.</i>—We continued our route at five o'clock,
steering South-East for ten miles across two deep bays; then
South-South-East, with islands in sight to the Eastward.  We then
traversed another bay in a course of three miles, then South one mile to
a point which we named the Detour, and South-South-West four miles and
an half, when there was an heavy swell of the lake.  Here I took
an observation,
when we were in 61. 40. North latitude We then proceeded South-West four
miles, and West-South-West among islands: on one of which our Indians
killed two rein-deer, but we lost three hours aft wind in going for
them: this course was nine miles.  About seven in the evening we were
obliged to land for the night, as the wind became too strong from the
South-East.  We thought we could observe land in this direction when the
wind was coming on from some distance.  On the other side of the Detour,
the land is low, and the shore is flat and dangerous, there being no
safe place to land in bad weather, except in the islands which we had
just passed.  There seemed to be plenty of moose and rein-deer in this
country, as we saw their tracks wherever we landed.  There are also
great numbers of white partridges, which were at this season of a grey
colour, like that of the moor-fowl.  There was some floating ice in the
lake, and the Indians killed a couple of swans.</p>

<br/><p><i>Saturday, 27.</i>—At three this morning we were in the
canoe, after having passed a very restless night from the persecution of
the mosquitoes The weather was fine and calm, and our course
West-South-West nine miles, when we came to the foot of a traverse, the
opposite point in sight bearing South-West, distance twelve miles.  The
bay is at least

eight miles deep, and this course two miles more, in all ten miles.  It
now became very foggy, and as the bays were so numerous, we landed for
two hours, when the weather cleared up, and we took the advantage of
steering South thirteen miles, and passed several small bays, when we
came to the point of a very deep one, whose extremity was not
discernible; the land bearing South from us, at the distance of about
ten miles.  Our guide not having been here for eight winters, was at a
loss what course to take, though as well as he could recollect, this bay
appeared to be the entrance of the river.  Accordingly, we steered down
it, about West-South-West, till we were involved in a field of broken
ice.  We still could not discover the bottom of the bay, and a fog
coming on, made it very difficult for us to get to an island to the
South-West, and it was nearly dark when we effected a landing.</p>

<br/><p><i>Sunday, 28.</i>—At a quarter past three we were again on
the water, and as we could perceive no current setting into this bay, we
made the best of our way to the point that bore South from us yesterday
afternoon.  We continued our course South three miles more, South by
West seven miles, West fifteen miles, when by observation we were in 61
degrees North latitude; we then proceeded West-North-West two miles.
Here we came to
the foot of a traverse, the opposite land bearing South-West, distance
fourteen miles, when we steered into a deep bay, about a westerly
course; and though we had no land ahead in sight, we indulged the hope
of finding a passage, which, according to the Indian, would conduct us
to the entrance of the river.</p>

<p>Having a strong wind aft, we lost sight of the Indians, nor could we
put on shore to wait for them, without risking material damage to the
canoe, till we ran to the bottom of the bay, and were forced among the
rushes; when we discovered that there was no passage there.  In about
two or three hours they joined us, but would not approach our fire, as
there was no good ground for an encampment: they emptied their canoe of
the water which it had taken in, and continued their route, but did not
encamp till sunset The English chief was very much irritated against the
Red-Knife Indian, and even threatened to murder him, for having
undertaken to guide us in a course of which he was ignorant, nor had we
any reason to be satisfied with him, though he still continued to
encourage us, by declaring that he recollected having passed from the
river, through the woods, to the place where he had landed.  In the
blowing weather to-day, we were obliged to make use of our large kettle,
to keep our canoe from filling, although we did not carry
above three feet
sail.  The Indians very narrowly escaped.</p>

<br/><p><i>Monday, 29.</i>—We embarked at four this morning, and
steered along the South-West side of the bay.  At half past five we
reached the extremity of the point, which we doubled, and found it to be
the branch or passage that was the object of our search, and occasioned
by a very long island, which separates it from the main channel of the
river.  It is about half a mile across, and not more than six feet in
depth; the water appeared to abound in fish, and was covered with fowl,
such as swans, geese, and several kinds of ducks, particularly black
ducks, that were very numerous, but we could not get within gun shot of
them.</p>

<p>The current, though not very strong, set us South-West by West, and
we followed this course fourteen miles, till we passed the point of the
long island, where the Slave Lake discharges itself, and is ten miles in
breadth.  There is not more than from five to two fathom water, so that
when the lake is low, it may be presumed the greatest part of this
channel must be dry.  The river now turns to the Westward, becoming
gradually narrower for twenty-four miles, till it is not more than half
a mile wide; the current, however, is then much stronger, and the
sounding were three fathom and a half.
The land on the
North shore from the lake is low, and covered with trees; that to the
South is much higher, and has also an abundance of wood.  The current is
very strong, and the banks are of an equal height on both sides,
consisting of a yellow clay, mixed with small stones; they are covered
with large quantities of burned wood, lying on the ground, and young
poplar trees, that have sprung up since the fire that destroyed the
larger wood.  It is a very curious and extraordinary circumstance, that
land covered with spruce pine, and white birch, when laid waste by fire,
should subsequently produce nothing but poplars, where none of that
species of tree were previously to be found.</p>

<p>A stiff breeze from the Eastward drove us on at a great rate under sail,
in the same course, though obliged to wind among the islands.  We kept
the North channel for about ten miles, whose current is much stronger
than that of the South; so that the latter is consequently the better
road to come up.  Here the river widened, and the wind dying away, we
had recourse to our paddles.  We kept our course to the North-West, on
the North side of the river, which is here much wider, and assumes the
form of a small lake; we could not, however, discover an opening in any
direction, so that we were at a loss what course to take, as our
Red-Knife 
Indian had never explored beyond our present situation.  He at
the same time informed us that a river falls in from the North, which
takes its rise in the Horn Mountain, now in sight, which is the country
of the Beaver Indians; and that he and his relations frequently meet on
that river.  He also added, that there are very extensive plains on both
sides of it, which abound in buffaloes and moose deer.</p>

<p>By keeping this course, we got into shallows, so that we were forced to
steer to the left, till we recovered deep water, which we followed till
the channel of the river opened on us to the southward, we now made for
the shore, and encamped soon after sunset.  Our course ought to have
been West fifteen miles, since we took to the paddle, the Horn Mountains
bearing from us North-West, and running North-North-East and South-South
West.  Our soundings, which were frequent during the course of the day,
were from three to six fathoms water.  The hunters killed two geese and
a swan: it appeared, indeed, that great numbers of fowls breed in the
islands which we had passed.</p>

<br/><p><i>Tuesday, 30.</i>—At four this morning we got under way,
the weather being fine and calm.  Our course was South-West by South
thirty-six miles.  On the South side of the river is a ridge of low
mountains, running East
and  West by
compass.  The Indians picked up a white goose, which appeared to have
been lately shot with an arrow, and was quite fresh.  We proceeded
South-West by South six miles, and then came to a bay on our left, which
is full of small islands, and appeared to be the entrance of a river
from the South.  Here the ridge of mountains terminates.  This course
was fifteen miles.</p>

<p>At six in the afternoon there was an appearance of bad weather; we
landed therefore, for the night; but before we could pitch our tents, a
violent tempest came on, with thunder, lightning, and rain, which,
however, soon ceased, but not before we had suffered the inconvenience
of being drenched by it.  The Indians were very much fatigued, having
been employed in running after wild fowl, which had lately cast their
feathers; they, however, caught five swans, and the same number of
geese.  I sounded several times in the course of the day, and found from
four to six fathoms water.</p>

<p class="noindent">JULY, 1789.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, 1.</i>—At half past four in the morning we
continued our voyage, and in a short time found the river narrowed to
about half a mile.  Our course was Westerly among islands, with a strong
current.  Though the land is high on both sides, the banks are not
perpendicular.  This course was twenty-one miles; and on sounding we
found nine fathoms water.  We then proceeded West-North-West nine miles,
and passed a river upon the South-East side; we sounded, and found
twelve fathoms; and then we went North-West by West three miles.  Here I
lost my lead, which had fastened at the bottom, with part of the line,
the current running so strong that we could not clear it with eight
paddles, and the strength of the line, which was equal to four paddles.
Continued North by West five miles, and saw a high mountain, bearing
South from us; we then proceeded North-West by North four miles.  We now
passed a small river on the North side, then doubled a point to
West-South-West.  At one o'clock there came on lightning and thunder,
with wind and rain, which ceased in about half
an  hour, and left
us almost deluged with wet, as we did not land.  There were great
quantities of ice along the banks of the river.</p>

<p>We landed upon a small island, where there were the poles of four lodges
standing, which we concluded to have belonged to the Knisteneaux, on
their war excursions, six or seven years ago.  This course was fifteen
miles West, to where the river of the Mountain falls in from the
Southward.  It appears to be a very large river, whose mouth is half a
mile broad.  About six miles further a small river flows in the same
direction; and our whole course was twenty-four miles.  We landed
opposite to an island, the mountains to the Southward being in sight.
As our canoe was deeply laden, and being also in daily expectation of
coming to the rapids or fall, which we had been taught to consider with
apprehension, we concealed two bags of pemmican in the opposite island,
in the hope that they would be of future service to us.  The Indians
were of a different opinion, as they entertained no expectation of
returning that season, when the hidden provisions would be spoiled. Near
us were two Indian encampments of the last year.  By the manner in which
these people cut their wood, it appears that they have no iron tools.
The current was very strong during the whole of this day's voyage, and
in the article of 
provisions two swans were all that the hunters were
able to procure.</p>

<br/><p><i>Thursday, 2.</i>—The morning was very foggy: but at half
past five we embarked; it cleared up, however, at seven, when we
discovered that the water, from being very limpid and clear, was become
dark and muddy.  This alteration must have proceeded from the influx of
some river to the Southward, but where these streams first blended their
waters, the fog had prevented us from observing.  At nine we perceived a
very high mountain ahead, which appeared, on our nearer approach, to be
rather a cluster of mountains, stretching as far as our view could reach
to the Southward, and whose tops were lost in the clouds.  At noon there
was lightning, thunder, and rain, and at one, we came abreast of the
mountains; their summits appeared to be barren and rocky, but their
declivities were covered with wood; they appeared also to be sprinkled
with white stones, which glistened in the sun, and were called by the
Indians manetoe aseniak, or spirit stones.  I suspected that they were
Talc, though they possessed a more brilliant whiteness; on our return,
however, these appearances were dissolved, as they were nothing more
than patches of snow.</p>

<p>Our course had been West-South-West thirty miles and we proceeded
with great 
caution, as we continually expected to approach some great rapid or
fall.  This was such a prevalent idea, that all of us were occasionally
persuaded that we heard those sounds which betokened a fall of water.
Our course changed to West by North, along the mountains, twelve miles,
North by West, twenty-one miles, and at eight o'clock in the evening, we
went on shore for the night, on the North side of the river.  We saw
several encampments of the natives, some of which had been erected in
the present spring, and others at some former period.  The hunters
killed only one swan and a beaver; the latter was the first of its kind
which we had seen in this river.  The Indians complained of the
perseverance with which we pushed forward, and that they were not
accustomed to such severe fatigue as it occasioned.</p>

<br/><p><i>Friday, 3.</i>—The rain was continual through the night,
and did not subside till seven this morning, when we embarked and
steered North-North-West for twelve miles, the river being enclosed by
high mountains on either side.  We had a strong head-wind, and the rain
was so violent as to compel us to land at ten o' clock.  According to my
reckoning, since my last observation, we had run two hundred and
seventeen miles West, and forty-four miles North.  At a quarter past two
the rain subsided, and we got again under way, our former course continuing
for five miles.  Here a river fell in from the North, and in a short
time the current became strong and rapid, running with great rapidity
among rocky islands, which were the first that we had seen in this
river, and indicated our near approach to rapids and falls.  Our present
course was North-West by North ten miles, North-West three miles,
West-North-West twelve miles, and North-West three miles, when we
encamped at eight in the evening, at the foot of an high hill, on the
North shore, which in some parts rose perpendicular from the river.  I
immediately ascended it, accompanied by two men and some Indians, and in
about an hour and an half, with very hard walking, we gained the summit,
when I was very much surprised to find it crowned by an encampment.  The
Indians informed me, that it is the custom of the people who have no
arms to choose these elevated spots for the places of their residence,
as they can render them inaccessible to their enemies, particularly the
Knisteneaux, of whom they are in continual dread.  The prospect from
this height was not so extensive as we expected, as it was terminated by
a circular range of hills, of the same elevation as that on which we
stood.  The intervals between the hills were covered with small lakes,
which were inhabited by great numbers of swans.  We saw no trees but the pine and
the birch, which were small in size and few in number.</p>

<p>We were obliged to shorten our stay here, from the swarms of mosquitoes
which attacked us on all sides and were, indeed, the only inhabitants of
the place.  We saw several encampments of the natives in the course of
the day, but none of them were of this year's establishment.  Since four
in the afternoon the current had been so strong, that it was at length,
in an actual ebullition, and produced an hissing noise like a kettle of
water in a moderate state of boiling.  The weather was now become
extremely cold, which was the more sensibly felt, as it had been very
sultry sometime before and since we had been in the river.</p>

<br/><p><i>Saturday, 4.</i>—At five in the morning, the wind and
weather having undergone no alteration from yesterday, we proceeded
North-West by West twenty-two miles, North-West six miles, North-West by
North four miles and West-North-West five miles; we then passed the
mouth of a small river from the North, and after doubling a point,
South-West one mile, we passed the influx of an other river from the
South.  We then continued our course North-North-West, with a mountain
ahead, fifteen miles, when the opening of two rivers appeared opposite
to each other: we then proceeded West four
miles,  and
North-West thirteen miles.  At eight in the evening, we encamped on an
island.  The current was as strong through the whole of this day as it
had been the preceding after-noon; nevertheless, a quantity of ice
appeared along the banks of the river.  The hunters killed a beaver and
a goose, the former of which sunk before they could get to him: beavers,
otters, bears, etc., if shot dead at once, remain like a bladder, but if
there remains enough of life for them to struggle, they soon fill with
water and go to the bottom.</p>

<br/><p><i>Sunday, 5.</i>—The sun set last night at fifty-three
minutes past nine, by my watch, and rose at seven minutes before two
this morning: we embarked soon after, steering North-North-West, through
islands for five miles, and West four miles.  The river then increased
in breadth, and the current began to slacken in a small degree; after
the continuation of our course, we perceived a ridge of high mountains
before us, covered with snow.  West-South-West ten miles, and at
three-quarters past seven o'clock, we saw several smokes on the North
shore, which we made every exertion to approach.  As we drew nearer, we
discovered the natives running about in great apparent confusion; some
were making to the woods, and others hurrying to their canoes.  Our
hunters landed before
us, and addressed
the few that had not escaped, in the Chipewyan language, which, so great
was their confusion and terror, they did not appear to understand.  But
when they perceived that it was impossible to avoid us, as we were all
landed, they made us signs to keep at a distance, with which we
complied, and not only unloaded our canoe, but pitched our tents, before
we made any attempt to approach them.  During this interval, the English
chief and his young men were employed in reconciling them to our
arrival; and when they had recovered from their alarm of hostile
intention, it appeared that some of them perfectly comprehended the
language of our Indians; so that they were at length persuaded, though
not without evident signs of reluctance and apprehension, to come to us.
Their reception, however, soon dissipated their fears, and they hastened
to call their fugitive companions from their hiding places.</p>

<p>There were five families, consisting of twenty-five or thirty persons,
and of two different tribes, the Slave and Dog-rib Indians.  We made
them smoke, though it was evident they did not know the use of tobacco;
we likewise supplied them with grog; but I am disposed to think, that
they accepted our civilities rather from fear than inclination.  We
acquired a more effectual influence over them by the distribution of
knives, beads, 
awls, rings, gartering, fire-steels, flints, and hatchets;
so that they became more familiar even than we expected, for we could
not keep them out of our tents: though I did not observe that they
attempted to purloin any-thing.</p>

<p>The information which they gave respecting the river, had so much of the
fabulous, that I shall not detail it: it will be sufficient just to
mention their attempts to persuade us that it would require several
winters to get to the sea, and that old age would come upon us before
the period of our return: we were also to encounter monsters of such
horrid shapes and destructive powers as could only exist in their wild
imaginations.  They added, besides, that there were two impassable falls
in the river, the first of which was about thirty days march from us.</p>

<p>Though I placed no faith in these strange relations, they had a very
different effect upon our Indians, who were already tired of the voyage.
It was their opinion and anxious wish, that we should not hesitate to
return.  They said that, according to the information which they had
received, there were very few animals in the country beyond us, and that
as we proceeded, the scarcity would increase, and we should absolutely
perish from hunger, if no other accident befel us.  It was with no small
trouble that 
they were convinced of the folly of these reasonings; and
by my desire, they induced one of those Indians to accompany us, in
consideration of a small kettle, an axe, a knife, and some other
articles.</p>

<p>Though it was now three o'clock in the afternoon, the canoe was ordered
to be re-loaded, and as we were ready to embark our new recruit was
desired to prepare himself for his departure, which he would have
declined; but as none of his friends would take his place, we may be
said, after the delay of an hour, to have compelled him to embark.
Previous to his departure a ceremony took place, of which I could not
learn the meaning; he cut off a lock of his hair, and having divided it
into three parts, he fastened one of them to the hair on the upper part
of his wife's head, blowing on it three times with the utmost violence
in his power, and uttering certain words.  The other two he fastened
with the same formalities, on the heads of his two children.</p>

<p>During our short stay with these people, they amused us with dancing,
which they accompanied with their voices: but neither their song or
their dance possessed much variety.  The men and women formed a
promiscuous ring.  The former have a bone dagger or piece of stick
between the fingers of the right hand, which they keep extended above
the head, in continual motion: the left they seldom raise so high, but
work it backwards and forwards in a horizontal direction; while they
leap about and throw themselves into various antic postures, to the
measure of their music, always bringing their heels close to each other
at every pause.  The men occasionally howl in imitation of some animal,
and he who continues this violent exercise for the longest period,
appears to be considered as the best performer.  The women suffer their
arms to hang as without the power of motion.  They are a meagre, ugly,
ill-made people, particularly about the legs, which are very clumsy and
covered with scabs.  The latter circumstance proceeds probably from
their habitually roasting them before the fire.  Many of them appeared
to be in a very unhealthy state, which is owing, as I imagine, to their
natural filthiness.  They are of a moderate stature, and as far as could
be discovered, through the coat of dirt and grease that covers them, are
of a fairer complexion than the generality of Indians who are the
natives of warmer climates.</p>

<p>Some of them have their hair of a great length; while others suffer a
long tress to fall behind, and the rest is cut so short as to expose
their ears, but no other attention whatever is paid to it.  The beards
of some of the old men were long, and the rest had them pulled out by
the roots so that not a hair could be seen on their chins.  The men have
two double lines, either black or blue, tattooed upon each cheek, from
the ear to the nose.  The gristle of the latter is perforated so as to
admit a goose-quill or a small piece of wood to be passed through the
orifice.  Their clothing is made of the dressed skins of the rein or
moose-deer, though more commonly of the former.  These they prepare in
the hair for winter, and make shirts of both, which reach to the middle
of their thighs.  Some of them are decorated with an embroidery of very
neat workmanship with porcupine quills and the hair of the moose,
coloured red, black, yellow, and white.  Their upper garments are
sufficiently large to cover the whole body, with a fringe round the
bottom, and are used both sleeping and awake.  Their leggins come half
way up the thigh, and are sewed to their shoes: they are embroidered
round the ancle, and upon every seam.  The dress of the women is the
same as that of the men.  The former have no covering on their private
parts, except a tassel of leather which dangles from a small cord, as it
appears, to keep off the flies, which would otherwise be very
troublesome.  Whether circumcision be practised among them, I cannot
pretend to say, but the appearance of it was general among those whom I
saw.</p>

<p>
Their ornaments consist of gorgets, bracelets for the arms and wrists,
made of wood, horn, or bone, belts, garters, and a kind of band to go
round the head, composed of strips of leather of one inch and an half
broad, embroidered with porcupine quills, and stuck round with the claws
of bears or wild fowl inverted, to which are suspended a few short
thongs of the skin of an animal that resembles the ermine, in the form
of a tassel.  Their cinctures and garters are formed of porcupine quills
woven with sinews, in a style of peculiar skill and neatness: they have
others of different materials, and more ordinary workmanship; and to
both they attach a long fringe of strings of leather, worked round with
hair of various colours.  Their mittens are also suspended from the neck
in a position convenient for the reception of the hands.</p>

<p>Their lodges are of a very simple structure: a few poles supported by a
fork, and forming a semicircle at the bottom, with some branches or a
piece of bark as a covering, constitutes the whole of their native
architecture.  They build two of these huts facing each other, and make
the fire between them.  The furniture harmonises with the buildings:
they have a few dishes of wood, bark, or horn; the vessels in which they
cook their victuals are in the shape of a gourd, narrow at the top and

wide at the bottom, and of watape,<a name="chap3-l1" href="#chap3-r1">[1]</a> fabricated in such a manner as to
hold water, which is made to boil by putting a succession of red-hot
stones into it.  These vessels contain from two to six gallons. They
have a number of small leather bags to hold their embroidered work,
lines, and nets.  They always keep an large quantity of the fibres of
willow bark, which they work into thread on their thighs.  Their nets
are from three to forty fathoms in length, and from thirteen to
thirty-six inches in depth.  The short deep ones they set in the eddy
current of rivers, and the long ones in the lakes.  They likewise make
lines of the sinews of the rein-deer, and manufacture their hooks from
wood, horn, or bone.  Their arms and weapons for hunting, are bows and
arrows, spears, daggers, and pogamagans, or clubs.  The bows are about
five or six feet in length, and the strings are of sinews or raw skins.
The arrows are two feet and an half long, including the barb, which is
variously formed of bone, horn, flint, iron, or copper, and are winged
with three feathers.  The pole of the spears is about six feet in
length, and pointed with a barbed bone of ten inches.  With this weapon
they strike the rein-deer in the water.  The daggers are flat and
sharp-pointed, about twelve inches long, and made of horn or bone.  The
pogamagon is made of the horn of the rein-deer, the branches being all
cut off, except that which forms the extremity.  This instrument is
about two feet in length, and is employed to despatch their enemies in
battle, and such animals as they catch in snares placed for that
purpose.  These are about three fathom long, and are made of the green
skin of the rein or moose-deer, but in such small strips, that it
requires from ten to thirty strands to make this cord, which is not
thicker than a cod-line; and strong enough to resist any animal that can
be entangled in it.  Snares or nooses are also made of sinews to take
lesser animals, such as hares and white partridges, which are very
numerous.  Their axes are manufactured of a piece of brown or grey stone
from six to eight inches long, and two inches thick.  The inside is
flat, and the outside round and tapering to an edge, an inch wide.  They
are fastened by the middle with the flat side inwards to a handle two
feet long, with a cord of green skin.  This is the tool with which they
split their wood, and we believe, the only one of its kind among them,

They kindle fire, by striking together a piece of white or yellow
pyrites and a flint stone, over a piece of touchwood.  They are
universally provided with a small bag containing these materials, so
that they are in a continual state of preparation to produce fire.  From
the adjoining tribes, the Red-Knives and Chepewyans, they procure, in
barter for marten skins and a few beaver, small pieces of iron, of which
they manufacture knives, by fixing them at the end of a short stick, and
with them and the beaver's teeth, they finish all their work.  They keep
them in a sheath hanging to their neck, which also contains their awls
both of iron and horn.</p>

<p>Their canoes are small, pointed at both ends, flat-bottomed and covered
in the fore part.  They are made of the bark of the birch-tree and
fir-wood, but of so slight a construction, that the man whom one of
these light vessels bears on the water, can, in return, carry it over
land without any difficulty.  It is very seldom that more than one
person embarks in them, nor are they capable of receiving more than two.
The paddles are six feet long, one half of which is occupied by a blade
of about eight inches wide.  These people informed us, that we had
passed large bodies of Indians who inhabit the mountains on the east
side of the river.</p>

<p>At four in the afternoon we embarked, and our Indian acquaintance
promised to remain on the bank of the river till the fall, in case we
should return.  Our course was West-South-West, and we soon passed the
Great Bear Lake River, which is of a considerable depth and an hundred
yards wide: its water is clear, and has the greenish hue of the sea.  We
had not proceeded more than six miles when we were obliged to land for
the night, in consequence of an heavy gust of wind, accompanied with
rain.  We encamped beneath a rocky hill, on the top of which, according
to the information of our guide, it blew a storm every day throughout
the year.  He found himself very uncomfortable in his new situation, and
pretended that he was very ill, in order that he might be permitted to
return to his relations.  To prevent his escape, it became necessary to
keep a strict watch over him during the night.</p>

<br/><p><i>Monday, 6.</i>—At three o'clock, in a very raw and
cloudy morning, we embarked, and steered West-South-West four miles,
West four miles, West-North-West five miles, West eight miles, West by
South fifteen miles, West twenty-seven miles, South-West nine miles,
then West six miles, and encamped at half past seven.  We passed through
numerous islands, and had a ridge of snowy mountains always in sight.
Our conductor informed us that great numbers
of bears and small
white buffaloes, frequent those mountains, which are also inhabited by
Indians.  We encamped in a similar situation to that of the preceding
evening, beneath another high rocky hill, which I attempted to ascend,
in company with one of the hunters, but before we had got half way to
the summit, we were almost suffocated by clouds of mosquitoes, and were
obliged to return.  I observed, however, that the mountains terminated
here, and that a river flowed from the Westward: I also discovered a
strong rippling current, or rapid, which ran close under a steep
precipice of the hill.</p>

<br/><p><i>Tuesday, 7.</i>—We embarked at four in the morning and
crossed to the opposite side of the river, in consequence of the rapid;
but we might have spared ourselves this trouble, as there would have
been no danger in continuing our course, without any circuitous
deviation whatever.  This circumstance convinced us of the erroneous
account given by the natives of the great and approaching dangers of our
navigation, as this rapid was stated to be one of them.  Our course was
now North-North-West three miles, West-North-West four miles, North-West
ten miles, North two miles, when we came to a river that flowed from the
Eastward.  Here we landed at an encampment of four fires, all the
inhabitants of which ran off with the utmost speed except and old man
and an old woman.
Our guide called aloud to the fugitives, and entreated them to stay, but
without effect the old man, however, did not hesitate to approach us,
and represented himself as too far advanced in life, and too indifferent
about the short time he had to remain in the world, to be very anxious
about escaping from any danger that threatened him; at the same time he
pulled his grey hairs from his head by handfuls to distribute among us,
and implored our favour for himself and his relations.  Our guide,
however, at length removed his fears, and persuaded him to recall the
fugitives, who consisted of eighteen people; whom I reconciled to me on
their return with presents of beads, knives, awls, &amp;c., with which
they appeared to be greatly delighted.  They differed in no respect from
those whom we had already seen; nor were they deficient in hospitable
attentions; they provided us with fish, which was very well boiled, and
cheerfully accepted by us.  Our guide still sickened after his home, and
was so anxious to return thither, that we were under the necessity of
forcing him to embark.</p>

<p>These people informed us that we were close to another great rapid, and
that there were several lodges of their relations in its vicinity.</p>

<p>Four canoes, with a man in each, followed us, to point out the
particular channels we should follow for the secure passage of the

rapid.  They also abounded in discouraging stories concerning the
dangers and difficulties which we were to encounter.</p>

<p>From hence our course was North-North-East two miles, when the river
appeared to be enclosed, as it were, with lofty, perpendicular, white
rocks, which did not afford us a very agreeable prospect.  We now went
on shore, in order to examine the rapid, but did not perceive any signs
of it, though the Indians still continued to magnify its dangers:
however, as they ventured down it, in their small canoes, our
apprehensions were consequently removed, and we followed them at some
distance, but did not find any increase in the rapidity of the current;
at length the Indians informed us that we should find no other rapid but
that which was now bearing us along.  The river at this place is not
above three hundred yards in breadth, but on sounding I found fifty
fathoms water.  At the two rivulets that offer their tributary streams
from either side, we found six families, consisting of about thirty-five
persons, who gave us an ample quantity of excellent fish, which were,
however, confined to white fish, the poisson inconnu, and another of a
round form and greenish colour, which was about fourteen inches in
length.  We gratified them with a few presents, and continued our
voyage.  The men, however, followed us in fifteen canoes.</p>

<p>This narrow
channel is three miles long, and its course
North-North-East.  We then steered North three miles, and landed at an
encampment of three or more families, containing twenty-two persons,
which was situated on the bank of a river, of a considerable appearance,
which came from the Eastward.  We obtained hares and partridges from
these people, and presented in return such articles as greatly delighted
them.  They very much regretted that they had no goods or merchandise to
exchange with us, as they had left them at a lake, from whence the river
issued, and in whose vicinity some of their people were employed in
setting snares for rein-deer.  They engaged to go for their articles of
trade, and would wait our return, which we assumed them would be within
two months.  There was a youth among them in the capacity of a slave,
whom our Indians understood much better than any of the natives of this
country whom they had yet seen; he was invited to accompany us, but took
the first opportunity to conceal himself, and we saw him no more.</p>

<p>We now steered West five miles, when we again landed, and found two
families, containing seven people, but had reason to believe that there
were others hidden in the woods.  We received from them two dozen of
hares, and they were about to boil two more, which they also gave us.
We were not ungrateful for their kindness, and left them.  Our course
was now North-West four miles, and at nine we landed and pitched our
tents, when one of our people killed a grey crane.  Our conductor
renewed his complaints, not, as he assured us, from any apprehension of
our ill treatment, but of the Esquimaux, whom he represented as a very
wicked and malignant people; who would put us all to death.  He added,
also, that it was but two summers since a large party of them came up
this river, and killed many of his relations.  Two Indians followed us
from the last lodges.</p>

<br/><p><i>Wednesday, 8.</i>—At half past two in the morning we
embarked, and steered a Westerly course, and soon after put ashore at
two lodges of nine Indians.  We made them a few trifling presents, but
without disembarking, and had proceeded but a small distance from
thence, when we observed several smokes beneath a hill, on the North
shore, and on our approach we perceived the natives climbing the ascent
to gain the woods.  The Indians, however, in the two small canoes which
were ahead of us, having assured them of our friendly intentions, they
returned to their fires, and we disembarked.  Several of them were clad
in hare-skins, but in every other circumstance they resembled those whom
we had already seen.  We
were,  however,
informed that they were of a different tribe, called the Hare Indians,
as hares and fish are their principal support, from the scarcity of
rein-deer and beaver, which are the only animals of the larger kind that
frequent this part of the country.  They were twenty-five in number; and
among them was a woman who was afflicted with an abscess in the belly,
and reduced, in consequence, to a mere skeleton: at the same time
several old women were singing and howling around her; but whether these
noises were to operate as a charm for her cure, or merely to amuse and
console her, I do not pretend to determine.  A small quantity of our
usual presents were received by them with the greatest satisfaction.</p>

<p>Here we made an exchange of our guide, who had become so troublesome
that we were obliged to watch him night and day, except when he was upon
the water.  The man, however, who had agreed to go in his place soon
repented of his engagement, and endeavoured to persuade us that some of
his relations further down the river, would readily accompany us, and
were much better acquainted with the river than himself.  But, as he had
informed us ten minutes before that we should see no more of his tribe,
we paid very little attention to his remonstrances, and compelled him to
embark.</p>

<p>In about
three hours a man overtook us in a canoe, and we suspected that
his object was to facilitate, in some way or other, the escape of our
conductor.  About twelve we also observed an Indian walking along the
North-East shore, when the small canoes paddled towards him.  We
accordingly followed, and found three men, three women, and two
children, who had been on an hunting expedition.  They had some flesh of
the rein-deer, which they offered to us, but it was so rotten, as well
as offensive to the smell, that we excused ourselves from accepting it.
They had also their wonderful stories of danger and terror, as well as
their countrymen, whom we had already seen; and we were now informed,
that behind the opposite island there was a Manitoe or spirit, in the
river, which swallowed every person that approached it.  As it would
have employed half a day to have indulged our curiosity in proceeding to
examine this phenomenon, we did not deviate from our course, but left
these people with the usual presents, and proceeded on our voyage.  Our
course and distance this day were West twenty-eight miles,
West-North-West twenty-three miles, West-South-West six miles, West by
North five miles, South-West four miles, and encamped at eight o'clock.
A fog prevailed the greater part of the day, with frequent showers of
small rain.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="chap3-r1" href="#chap3-l1">[1]</a> Watape
is the name given to the divided roots of the spruce fir,

are also sewed together with this kind of filament.</p>

<h4><a name="chapter4" href="#toc_chapter4"> CHAPTER IV.</a></h4>

<p class="noindent">JULY, 1789.</p>

<p> &amp;nbsp<i>Thursday, 9.</i>—Thunder and rain prevailed during the
night, and, in the course of it, our guide deserted; we therefore compelled
another of these people, very much against his will, to supply the place of
his fugitive countryman.  We also took away the paddles of one of them who
remained behind, that he might not follow us on any scheme of promoting
the escape of his companion, who was not easily pacified.  At length,
however, we succeeded in the act of conciliation, and at half past three
quitted our station.  In a short time we saw a smoke on the East shore,
and directed our course towards it.  Our new guide began immediately to
call to the people that belonged to it in a particular manner, which we
did not comprehend.  He informed us that they were not of his tribe, but
were a very wicked, malignant people, who would beat us cruelly, pull
our hair with great violence from our heads, and maltreat us in various
other ways.</p>

<p>The men waited our arrival, but the women and children took to the
woods.  There were but four of these people, and previous to our
landing, they all harangued us at the same moment, and apparently with
violent anger and resentment.  Our hunters did not understand them, but
no sooner had our guide addressed them, than they were appeased.  I
presented them with beads, awls, etc., and when the women and children
returned from the woods, they were gratified with similar articles.
There were fifteen of them; and of a more pleasing appearance than any
which we had hitherto seen, as they were healthy, full of flesh, and
clean in their persons.  Their language was somewhat different, but I
believe chiefly in the accent, for they and our guide conversed
intelligibly with each other; and the English chief clearly comprehended
one of them, though he was not himself understood.</p>

<p>Their arms and utensils differ but little from those which have been
described in a former chapter.  The only iron they have is in small
pieces, which serve them for knives.  They obtain this metal from the
Esquimaux Indians.  Their arrows are made of very light wood, and are
winged only with two feathers; their bows differed from any which we had
seen, and we understood that they were furnished by the Esquimaux, who
are their neighbours: they consist of two pieces, with a very strong
cord of sinews along the back, which is tied in several places, to
preserve  its
shape; when this cord becomes wet, it requires a strong bow-string, and
a powerful arm to draw it.  The vessel in which they prepare their food,
is made of a thin frame of wood, and of an oblong shape; the bottom is
fixed in a groove, in the same manner as a cask.  Their shirts are not
cut square at the bottom, but taper to a point, from the belt downwards
as low as the knee, both before and behind, with a border, embellished
with a short fringe.  They use also another fringe, similar to that
which has been already described, with the addition of the stone of a
grey farinaceous berry, of the size and shape of a large barley-corn: it
is of a brown colour, and fluted, and being bored is run on each string
of the fringe; with this they decorate their shirts, by sewing it in a
semicircle on the breast and back, and crossing over both shoulders; the
sleeves are wide and short, but the mittens supply their deficiency, as
they are long enough to reach over a part of the sleeve, and are
commodiously suspended by a cord from the neck.  If their leggins were
made with waistbands, they might with great propriety be denominated
trousers: they fasten them with a cord round the middle, so that they
appear to have a sense of decency which their neighbours can not boast.
Their shoes are sewed to their leggins, and decorated on every seam.
One  of the men was
clad in a shirt made of the skins of the musk-rat.  The dress of the
women is the same as that of the men, except in their shirts, which are
longer, and without the finishing of a fringe on their breast.  Their
peculiar mode of tying the hair is as follows:—that which grows on
the temples, or the fore part of the skull, is formed into two queues,
hanging down before the ears; that of the scalp or crown is fashioned in
the same manner to the back of the neck, and is then tied with the rest
of the hair, at some distance from the head.  A thin cord is employed
for these purposes, and very neatly worked with hair, artificially
coloured.  The women, and, indeed, some of the men, let their hair hang
loose on their shoulders, whether it be long or short.</p>

<p>We purchased a couple of very large moose skins from them, which were
very well dressed; indeed we did not suppose that there were any of
those animals in the country; and it appears from the accounts of the
natives themselves, that they are very scarce.  As for the beaver, the
existence of such a creature does not seem to be known by them.  Our
people bought shirts of them, and many curious articles, &amp;c.  They
presented us with a most delicious fish, which was less than a herring,
and very beautifully spotted with black and yellow: its dorsal fin
reached from 
the head to the tail; in its expanded state takes a
triangular form, and is variegated with the colours that enliven the
scales: the head is very small, and the mouth is armed with
sharp-pointed teeth.</p>

<p>We prevailed on the native, whose language was most intelligible, to
accompany us.  He informed us that we should sleep ten nights more
before we arrived at the sea; that several of his relations resided in
the immediate vicinity of this part of the river, and that in three
nights we should meet with the Esquimaux, with whom they had formerly
made war, but were now in a state of peace and amity.  He mentioned the
last Indians whom we had seen in terms of great derision; describing
them as being no better than old women, and as abominable liars; which
coincided with the notion we already entertained of them.</p>

<p>As we pushed off, some of my men discharged their fowling pieces, that
were only loaded with powder, at the report of which the Indians were
very much alarmed, as they had not before heard the discharge of
firearms.  This circumstance had such an effect upon our guide, that we
had reason to apprehend he would not fulfil his promise.  When, however,
he was informed that the noise which he had heard was a signal of
friendship, he was persuaded to embark in his own small canoe, though he
had been offered a seat in ours.</p>

<p>Two of his companions, whom he represented as his brothers, followed us
in their canoes; and they amused us not only with their native songs,
but with others, in imitation of the Esquimaux; and our new guide was so
enlivened by them, that the antics he performed, in keeping time to the
singing, alarmed us with continual apprehension that his boat must
upset: but he was not long content with his confined situation, and
paddling up alongside our canoe, requested us to receive him in it,
though but a short time before he had resolutely refused to accept our
invitation.  No sooner had he entered our canoe, than he began to
perform an Esquimaux dance, to our no small alarm.  He was, however,
soon prevailed upon to be more tranquil; when he began to display
various indecencies, according to the customs of the Esquimaux, of which
he boasted an intimate acquaintance.  On our putting to shore, in order
to leave his canoe, he informed us, that on the opposite hill the
Esquimaux, three winters before, killed his grandfather.  We saw a fox,
and a ground-hog on the hill, the latter of which the brother of our
guide shot with his bow and arrow.</p>

<p>About four in the afternoon we perceived a smoke on the West shore, when
we traversed 
and landed. The natives made a most terrible uproar,
talking with great vociferation, and running about as if they were
deprived of their senses, while the greater part of the women, with the
children, fled away.  Perceiving the disorder which our appearance
occasioned among these people, we had waited some time before we quitted
the canoe; and I have no doubt, if we had been without people to
introduce us, that they would have attempted some violence against us;
for when the Indians send away their women and children, it is always
with a hostile design.  At length we pacified them with the usual
presents, but they preferred beads to any of the articles that I offered
them; particularly such as were of a blue colour; and one of them even
requested to exchange a knife which I had given him for a small quantity
of those ornamental baubles.  I purchased of them two shirts for my
hunters; and at the same time they presented me with some arrows, and
dried fish.  This party consisted of five families, to the amount, as I
suppose, of forty men, women, and children; but I did not see them all,
as several were afraid to venture from their hiding-places.  They are
called <i>Deguthee Dinees</i>, or the <i>Quarrellers</i>.</p>

<p>Our guide, like his predecessors, now manifested his wish to leave us,
and entertained similar apprehensions that we should not return by this
passage.  He had his alarms also respecting the Esquimaux, who might
kill us and take away the women.  Our Indians, however, assured him that
we had no fears of any kind, and that he need not be alarmed for
himself.  They also convinced him that we should return by the way we
were going, so that he consented to re-embark without giving us any
further trouble; and eight small canoes followed us.  Our courses this
day were South-West by West six miles, South-West by South thirty miles,
South-West three miles, West by South twelve miles, West by North two
miles, and we encamped at eight in the evening on the Eastern bank of
the river.</p>

<p>The Indians whom I found here, informed me, that from the place where
I this morning met the first of their tribe, the distance overland, on
the East side, to the sea, was not long, and that from hence, by
proceeding to the Westward, it was still shorter.  They also represented
the land on both sides as projecting to a point.  These people do not
appear to harbour any thievish dispositions; at least we did not
perceive that they took, or wanted to take, anything from us by stealth
or artifice.  They enjoyed the amusements of dancing and jumping in
common with those we had already seen; and, indeed, these exercises seem
to be their favourite
diversions.   About
mid-day the weather was sultry, but in the afternoon it became cold.
There was a large quantity of wild flax, the growth of last year, laying
on the ground, and the new plants were sprouting up through it.  This
circumstance I did not observe in any other part.</p>

<br/><p><i>Friday, 10.</i>—At four in the morning we embarked, at a
small distance from the place of our encampment; the river, which here
becomes narrower, flows between high rocks; and a meandering course took
us North-West four miles.  At this spot the banks became low; indeed,
from the first rapid, the country does not wear a mountainous
appearance; but the banks of the river are generally lofty, in some
places perfectly naked, and in others well covered with small trees,
such as the fir and the birch.  We continued our last course for two
miles, with mountains before us; whose tops were covered with snow.</p>

<p>The land is low on both sides of the river, except these mountains,
whose base is distant about ten miles: here the river widens, and runs
through various channels, formed by islands, some of which are without a
tree, and little more than banks of mud and sand; while others are
covered with a kind of spruce fir, and trees of a larger size than we
had seen for the last ten days.  Their banks, which are about six feet
above the surface of 
the water, display a face of solid ice, intermixed
with veins of black earth, and as the heat of the sun melts the ice, the
trees frequently fall into the river.</p>

<p>So various were the channels of the river at this time, that we were at
a loss which to take.  Our guide preferred the Easternmost, on account
of the Esquimaux, but I determined to take the middle channel, as it
appeared to be a larger body of water, and running North and South:
besides, as there was a greater chance of seeing them I concluded, that
we could always go to the Eastward, whenever we might prefer it.  Our
course was now West by North six miles, North-West by West, the snowy
mountains being West by South from us, and stretching to the Northward
as far as we could see.  According to the information of the Indians,
they are part of the chain of mountains which we approached on the third
of this month.  I obtained an observation this day that gave me
67. 47. North latitude, which was farther North than I expected,
according to the course I kept: but the difference was owing to the
variation of the compass, which was more Easterly than I imagined.  From
hence it was evident that these waters emptied themselves into the
Hyperborean Sea; and though it was probable that, from the want of
provision, we could not return to Athabasca in the course of the season,
I nevertheless, determined to penetrate to the discharge of them.</p>

<p>My new conductor being very much discouraged and quite tired of his
situation, used his influence to prevent our proceeding.  He had never
been, he said, at the <i>Benahullo Toe</i>, or White Man's Lake; and that
when he went to the Esquimaux Lake, which is at no great distance, he
passed over land from the place where we found him, and to that part
where the Esquimaux pass the summer.  In short, my hunters also became
so disheartened from these accounts, and other circumstances, that I was
confident they would have left me, if it had been in their power.  I,
however, satisfied them in some degree, by the assurance, that I would
proceed onwards but seven days more, and if I did not then get to the
sea, I would return.  Indeed, the low state of our provisions, without
any other consideration, formed a very sufficient security for the
maintenance of my engagement.  Our last course was thirty-two miles,
with a stronger current than could be expected in such a low country.</p>

<p>We now proceeded North-North-West four miles, North-West three miles,
North-East two miles, North-West by West three miles, and North-East two
miles.  At half past eight in the evening we landed and
pitched our
tents, near to where there had been three encampments of the Esquimaux,
since the breaking up of the ice.  The natives, who followed us
yesterday, left us at our station this morning.  In the course of the
day we saw large flocks of wild fowl.</p>

<br/><p><i>Saturday, 11.</i>—I sat up all night to observe the sun.
At half past twelve I called up one of the men to view a spectacle which
he had never before seen; when, on seeing the sun so high, he thought it
was a signal to embark, and began to call the rest of his companions,
who would scarcely be persuaded by me, that the sun had not descended
nearer to the horizon, and that it was now but a short time past
midnight.</p>

<p>We reposed, however, till three quarters after three, when we entered
the canoe, and steered about North-West, the river taking a very
serpentine course.  About seven we saw a ridge of high land; at twelve
we landed at a spot where we observed that some of the natives had
lately been.  I counted thirty places where there had been fires; and
some of the men who went further, saw as many more.  They must have been
here for a considerable time, though it does not appear that they had
erected any huts.  A great number of poles, however, were seen fixed in
the river, to which they had attached their nets, and there seemed to be
an excellent fishery.  
One of the fish, of the many which we saw leap
out of the water, fell into our canoe; it was about ten inches long, and
of a round shape.  About the places where they had made their fires,
were scattered pieces of whalebone, and thick burned leather, with parts
of the frames of three canoes; we could also observe where they had
spilled train oil; and there was the singular appearance of a spruce
fir, stripped of its branches to the top like an English May-pole.  The
weather was cloudy, and the air cold and unpleasant.  From this place
for about five miles, the river widens, it then flows in a variety of
narrow, meandering channels, amongst low islands, enlivened with no
trees, but a few dwarf willows.</p>

<p>At four, we landed, where there were three houses, or rather huts,
belonging to the natives.  The ground-plot is of an oval form, about
fifteen feet long, ten feet wide in the middle, and eight feet at either
end; the whole of it is dug about twelve inches below the surface of the
ground, and one half of it is covered over with willow branches; which
probably serves as a bed for the whole family.</p>

<p>A space, in the middle of the other part, of about four feet wide, is
deepened twelve inches more, and is the only spot in the house where a
grown person can stand upright.  One side of it is covered, as has been
already 
described, and the other is the hearth or fireplace, of which,
however, they do not make much use.  Though it was close to the wall,
the latter did not appear to be burned.  The door or entrance is in the
middle of one end of the house, and is about two feet and an half high,
and two feet wide, and has a covered way or porch five feet in length;
so that it is absolutely necessary to creep on all fours in order to get
into, or out of, this curious habitation.  There is a hole of about
eighteen inches square on the top of it, which serves the threefold
purpose of a window, an occasional door, and a chimney.  The underground
part of the floor is lined with split wood.  Six or eight stumps of
small trees driven into the earth, with the root upwards, on which are
laid some cross pieces of timber, support the roof of the building,
which is an oblong square of ten feet by six.  The whole is made of
drift-wood covered with branches and dry grass; over which is laid a
foot deep of earth.  On each side of these houses are a few square holes
in the ground of about two feet in depth, which are covered with split
wood and earth, except in the middle.  These appeared to be contrived
for the preservation of the winter stock of provisions.  In and about
the houses we found sledge runners and bones, pieces of whalebone, and
poplar bark cut in circles, which are used as corks to buoy the nets,
and are fixed to them by pieces of whalebone.  Before each hut a great
number of stumps of trees were fixed in the ground, upon which it
appeared that they hung their fish to dry.</p>

<p>We now continued our voyage, and encamped at eight o'clock.  I
calculated our course at about North-West, and, allowing for the
windings, that we had made fifty-four miles.  We expected, throughout
the day, to meet with some of the natives.  On several of the islands we
perceived the print of their feet in the sand, as if they had been there
but a few days before, to procure wild fowl.  There were frequent
showers of rain in the afternoon, and the weather was raw and
disagreeable.  We saw a black fox; but trees were now become very rare
objects, except a few dwarf willows, of not more than three feet in
height.</p>

<p>The discontents of our hunters were now renewed by the accounts which
our guide had been giving of that part of our voyage that was
approaching.  According to his information, we were to see a larger lake
on the morrow.  Neither he nor his relations, he said, knew any thing
about it, except that part which is opposite to, and not far from, their
country.  The Esquimaux alone, he added, inhabit its shores, and kill a
large fish that is found in it, which is a principal part of their food;
this, we presumed, must; be the whale.  He also mentioned white bears,
and another large animal which was seen in those parts, but our hunters
could not understand the description which he gave of it.  He also
represented their canoes as being of a large construction, which would
commodiously contain four or five families.  However, to reconcile the
English chief to the necessary continuance in my service, I presented
him with one of my capotes or travelling coats; at the same time, to
satisfy the guide, and keep him, if possible, in good humour, I gave him
a skin of the moose-deer, which, in his opinion, was a valuable present.</p>

<br/><p><i>Sunday, 12.</i>—It rained with violence throughout the
night, and till two in the morning; the weather continuing very cold.
We proceeded on the same meandering course as yesterday, the wind
North-North-West, and the country so naked that scarce a shrub was to be
seen.  At ten in the morning, we landed where there were four huts,
exactly the same as those which have been so lately described.  The
adjacent land is high and covered with short grass and flowers, though
the earth was not thawed above four inches from the surface; beneath
which was a solid body of ice.  This beautiful appearance, however, was
strangely contrasted with the ice and snow that are seen in the
valleys.  The
soil, where there is any, is a yellow clay mixed with stones.  These
huts appear to have been inhabited during the last winter; and we had
reason to think that some of the natives had been lately there, as the
beach was covered with the track of their feet.  Many of the runners and
bars of their sledges were laid together, near the houses, in a manner
that seemed to denote the return of the proprietors.  There were also
pieces of netting made of sinews, and some bark of the willow.  The
thread of the former was plaited, and no ordinary portion of time must
have been employed in manufacturing so great a length of cord.  A square
stone kettle, with a flat bottom, also occupied our attention, which was
capable of containing two gallons; and we were puzzled as to the means
these people must have employed to have chiselled it out of a solid rock
into its present form.  To these articles may be added, small pieces of
flint fixed into handles of wood, which probably serve as knives;
several wooden dishes; the stern and part of a large canoe; pieces of
very thick leather, which we conjectured to be the covering of a canoe;
several bones of large fish, and two heads; but we could not determine
the animal to which they belonged, though we conjectured that it must be
the sea-horse.</p>

<p>When we had satisfied our curiosity we
 re-embarked,
but we were at a loss what course to steer, as our guide seemed to be as
ignorant of this country as ourselves.  Though the current was very
strong, we appeared to have come to the entrance of the lake.  The
stream set to the West, and we went with it to an high point, at the
distance of about eight miles, which we conjectured to be an island;
but, on approaching it, we perceived it to be connected with the shore
by a low neck of land.  I now took an observation which gave
69. 1. North latitude.  From the point that has been just mentioned, we
continued the same course for the Westernmost point of an high island,
and the Westernmost land in sight, at the distance of fifteen miles.</p>

<p>The lake was quite open to us to the Westward, and out of the channel of
the river there was not more than four feet water, and in some places
the depth did not exceed one foot, From the shallowness of the water it
was impossible to coast to the Westward.  At five o'clock we arrived at
the island, and during the last fifteen miles, five feet was the deepest
water.  The lake now appeared to be covered with ice, for about two
leagues distance, and no land ahead, so that we were prevented from
proceeding in this direction by the ice, and the shallowness of the
water along the shore.</p>

<p>We landed at the boundary of our voyage in this direction, and as soon
as the tents were pitched I ordered the nets to be set, when I proceeded
with the English chief to the highest part of the island, from which we
discovered the solid ice, extending from the South-West by compass to
the Eastward.  As far as the eye could reach to the South-West-ward, we
could dimly perceive a chain of mountains, stretching further to the
North than the edge of the ice, at the distance of upwards of twenty
leagues.  To the Eastward we saw many islands, and in our progress we
met with a considerable number of white partridges, now become brown.
There were also flocks of very beautiful plovers, and I found the nest
of one of them with four eggs.  White owls, likewise, were among the
inhabitants of the place: but the dead, as well as the living, demanded
our attention, for we came to the grave of one of the natives, by which
lay a bow, a paddle, and a spear., The Indians informed me that they
landed on a small island, about four leagues from hence, where they had
seen the tracks of two men, that were quite fresh; they had also found a
secret store of train oil, and several bones of white bears were
scattered about the place where it was hid.  The wind was now so high
that it was impracticable for us to visit the nets.</p>

<p>My people could not, at this time, refrain from expressions of real
concern, that they were obliged to return without reaching the sea:
indeed, the hope of attaining this object encouraged them to bear,
without repining, the hardships of our unremitting voyage.  For some
time past their spirits were animated by the expectation that another
day would bring them to the <i>Mer d'ouest:</i> and even in our present
situation they declared their readiness to follow me wherever I should
be pleased to lead them.  We saw several large white gulls, and other
birds, whose back, and upper feathers of the wing are brown; and whose
belly, and under feathers of the wing are white.</p>

<p class="noindent">JULY, 1789.</p>
<p><i>Monday, 13.</i>—We had no sooner retired to rest last night,
if I may use that expression, in a country where the sun never sinks
beneath the horizon, than some of the people were obliged to rise and
remove the baggage, on account of the rising of the water.  At eight in
the morning the weather was fine and calm, which afforded an opportunity
to examine the nets, one of which had been driven from its position by
the wind and current.  We caught seven poissons inconnus, which were
unpalatable; a white fish, that proved delicious; and another about the
size of an herring, which none of us had ever seen before, except the
English chief, who recognized it as being of a kind that abounds in
Hudson's Bay.  About noon the wind blew hard from the Westward, when I
took an observation, which gave 69. 14. North latitude, and the meridian
variation of the compass was thirty-six degrees
Eastward.<a name="chap5-l1" href="#chap5-r1">[1]</a></p>

<p>This afternoon I re-ascended the hill, but could not discover that
the ice had been put
 in motion by
the force of the wind.  At the same time I could just distinguish two
small islands in the ice, to the North-West by compass.  I now thought
it necessary to give a new net to my men to mount, in order to obtain as
much provision as possible from the water, our stores being reduced to
about five hundred weight, which, without any other supply, would not
have sufficed for fifteen people above twelve days.  One of the young
Indians, however, was so fortunate as to find the net that had been
missing, and which contained three of the poissons inconnus.</p>

<br/><p><i>Tuesday, 14.</i>—It blew very hard from the North-West
since the preceding evening.  Having sat up till three in the morning, I
slept longer than usual; but about eight one of my men saw a great many
animals in the water, which he at first supposed to be pieces of ice.
About nine, however, I was awakened to resolve the doubts which had
taken place respecting this extraordinary appearance.  I immediately
perceived that they were whales; and having ordered the canoe to be
prepared, we embarked in pursuit of them.  It was, indeed, a very wild
and unreflecting enterprise, and it was a very fortunate circumstance
that we failed in our attempt to overtake them, as a stroke from the
tail of one of these enormous fish would have dashed the canoe to
pieces.  We may, perhaps, have been indebted to the foggy weather for our safety, as
it prevented us from continuing our pursuit.  Our guide informed us that
they are the same kind of fish which are the principal food of the
Esquimaux, and they were frequently seen as large as our canoe.  The
part of them which appeared above the water was altogether white, and
they were much larger than the largest porpoise.</p>

<p>About twelve the fog dispersed, and being curious to take a view of
the ice, I gave orders for the canoe to be got in readiness.  We
accordingly embarked, and the Indians followed us.  We had not, however,
been an hour on the water, when the wind rose on a sudden from the
North-East, and obliged us to tack about, and the return of the fog
prevented us from ascertaining our distance from the ice; indeed, from
this circumstance, the island which we had so lately left was but dimly
seen.  Though the wind was close, we ventured to hoist the sail, and
from the violence of the swell it was by great exertions that two men
could bale out the water from our canoe.  We were in a state of actual
danger, and felt every corresponding emotion of pleasure when we reached
the land.  The Indians had fortunately got more to windward, so that the
swell in some measure drove them on shore, though their canoes were
nearly filled with water: and had they
been  laden, we
should have seen them no more.  As I did not propose to satisfy my
curiosity at the risk of similar dangers, we continued our course along,
the islands, which screened us from the wind.  I was now determined to
take a more particular examination of the islands, in the hope of
meeting with parties of the natives, from whom I might be able to obtain
some interesting intelligence, though our conductor discouraged my
expectations, by representing them as very shy and inaccessible people.
At the same time he informed me, that we should probably find some of
them, if we navigated the channel which he had originally recommended us
to enter.</p>

<p>At eight we encamped on the Eastern end of the island, which I had named
the Whale Island.  It is about seven leagues in length, East and West by
compass; but not more than half a mile in breadth.  We saw several red
foxes, one of which was killed.  There were also five or six very old
huts on the point where we had taken our station.  The nets were now
set, and one of them in five fathom water, the current setting
North-East by compass.  This morning I ordered a post to be erected
close to our tents, on which engraved the latitude of the place, my own
name, the number of persons which I had with me, and the time we
remained there.</p>

<br/><p><i>Wednesday,
15.</i>—Being awakened by some casual circumstance, at four this
morning, I was surprised on perceiving that the water had flowed under
our baggage.  As the wind had not changed, and did not blow with greater
violence than when we went to rest, we were all of opinion that this
circumstance proceeded from the tide.  We had, indeed, observed at the
other end of the island, that the water rose and fell; but we then
imagined that it must have been occasioned by the wind.  The water
continued to rise till about six, but I could not ascertain the time
with the requisite precision, as the wind then began to blow with great
violence; I therefore determined, at all events, to remain here till the
next morning, though, as it happened, the state of the wind was such, as
to render my stay here an act of necessity.  Our nets were not very
successful, as they presented us with only eight fish.  From an
observation which I obtained at noon we were in 69.  7. North latitude.
As the evening approached, the wind increased, and the weather became
cold.  Two swans were the only provision which the hunters procured for
us.</p>

<br/><p><i>Thursday, 16.</i>—The rain did not cease till seven this
morning, the weather being at intervals very cold and unpleasant.  Such
was its inconstancy, that I could not make
an  accurate
observation; but the tide appeared to rise sixteen or eighteen
inches.</p>

<p>We now embarked, and steered under sail among the islands, where I hoped
to meet with some of the natives, but my expectation was not gratified.
Our guide imagined that they were gone to their distant haunts, where
they fish for whales and hunt the rein-deer, that are opposite to his
country.  His relations, he said, see them every year, but he did not
encourage us to expect that we should find any of them, unless it were
at a small river that falls into the great one, from the Eastward, at a
considerable distance from our immediate situation.  We accordingly made
for the river, and stemmed the current.  At two in the afternoon the
water was quite shallow in every part of our course, and we could always
find the bottom with the paddle.  At seven we landed, encamped, and set
the nets.  Here the Indians killed two geese, two cranes, and a white
owl. Since we entered the river, we experienced a very agreeable change
in the temperature of the air; but this pleasant circumstance was not
without its inconvenience, as it subjected us to the persecution of the
mosquitoes.</p>

<br/><p><i>Friday, 17.</i>—On taking up the nets, they were found
to contain but six fish.  We embarked at four in the morning, and passed
four encampments; which appeared to
have  been very
lately inhabited.  We then landed upon a small round island, close to
the Eastern shore; which possessed somewhat of a sacred character, as
the top of it seemed to be a place of sepulture, from the numerous
graves which we observed there.  We found the frame of a small canoe,
with various dishes, troughs, and other utensils, which had been the
living property of those who could now use them no more, and form the
ordinary accompaniments of their last abodes.  As no part of the skins
that must have covered the canoe was remaining, we concluded that it had
been eaten by wild animals that inhabit, or occasionally frequent, the
island.  The frame of the canoe, which was entire, was put together with
whale-bone; it was sewed in some parts, and tied in others.  The sledges
were from four to eight feet long; the length of the bars was upwards of
two feet; the runners were two inches thick and nine inches deep; the
prow was two feet and an half high, and formed of two pieces, sewed with
whalebone, to three other thin spars of wood, which were of the same
height; and fixed in the runners by means of mortises, were sewed two
thin broad bars lengthways, at a small distance from each other; these
frames were fixed together with three or four cross bars, tied fast upon
the runners, and on the lower edge of the latter, small pieces
of horn were
fastened by wooden pegs, that they might slide with greater facility.
They are drawn by shafts, which I imagine are applied to any particular
sledge as they are wanted as I saw no more than one pair of them.</p>

<p>About half past one we came opposite to the first spruce-tree that we
had seen for some time: there are but very few of them on the main land,
and they are very small: those are larger which are found on the
islands, where they grow in patches, and close together.  It is, indeed,
very extraordinary that there should be any wood whatever in a country
where the ground never thaws above five inches from the surface.  We
landed at seven in the evening.  The weather was now very pleasant, and
in the course of the day we saw great numbers of wild fowl, with their
young ones, but they were so shy that we could not approach them.  The
Indians were not very successful in their foraging party, as they killed
only two grey cranes, and a grey goose.  Two of them were employed on
the high land to the Eastward, through the greater part of the day, in
search of rein-deer, but they could discover nothing more than a few
tracks of that animal.  I also ascended the high land, from whence I had
a delightful view of the river, divided into innumerable streams,
meandering through islands, some of which were covered with wood and others with grass.
The mountains, that formed the opposite horizon, were at the distance of
forty miles.  The inland view was neither so extensive nor agreeable,
being terminated by a near range of bleak, barren hills, between which
are small lakes or ponds, while the surrounding country is covered with
tufts of moss, without the shade of a single tree.  Along the hills is a
kind of fence, made with branches, where the natives had set snares to
catch white partridges.</p>

<br/><p><i>Saturday, 18.</i>—The nets did not produce a single
fish, and at three o'clock in the morning we took our departure.  The
weather was fine and clear, and we passed several encampments.  As the
prints of human feet were very fresh in the sand, it could not have been
long since the natives had visited the spot.  We now proceeded in the
hope of meeting with some of them at the river, whither our guide was
conducting us with that expectation.  We observed a great number of
trees, in different places, whose branches had been lopped off to the
tops.  They denote the immediate abode of the natives, and probably
serve for signals to direct each other to their respective winter
quarters.  Our hunters, in the course of the day, killed two rein-deer,
which were the only large animals that we had seen since we had been in
this river, and proved a very
seasonable  supply,
as our pemmican had become mouldy for some time past; though in that
situation we were under the necessity of eating it.</p>

<p>In the valleys and low lands near the river, cranberries are found in
great abundance, particularly in favourable aspects.  It is a singular
circumstance, that the fruit of two succeeding years may be gathered at
the same time, from the same shrub.  Here was also another berry, of a
very pale yellow colour, that resembles a raspberry, and is of a very
agreeable flavour.  There is a great variety of other plants and herbs,
whose names and properties are unknown to me.</p>

<p>The weather became cold towards the afternoon, with the appearance of
rain, and we landed for the night at seven in the evening.  The Indians
killed eight geese.  During the greater part of the day I walked with
the English chief, and found it very disagreeable and fatiguing.  Though
the country is so elevated, it was one continual morass, except on the
summits of some barren hills.  As I carried my hanger in my hand, I
frequently examined if any part of the ground was in a state of thaw,
but could never force the blade into it, beyond the depth of six or
eight inches.  The face of the high land, towards the river, is in some
places rocky, and in others a mixture of sand and stone veined with a
kind of red earth, with which the natives bedaub themselves.</p>

<br/><p><i>Sunday, 19.</i>—It rained, and blew hard from the North,
till eight in the morning, when we discovered that our conductor had
escaped.  I was, indeed, surprised at his honesty, as he left the
moose-skin which I had given him for a covering, and went off in his
shirt, though the weather was very cold.  I inquired of the Indians if
they had given him any cause of offence, or had observed any recent
disposition in him to desert us, but they assured me that they had not
in any instance displeased him: at the same time they recollected that
he had expressed his apprehensions of being taken away as a slave; and
his alarms were probably increased on the preceding day, when he saw
them kill the two rein-deer with so much readiness.  In the afternoon
the weather became fine and clear, when we saw large flights of geese
with their young ones, and the hunters killed twenty-two of them.  As
they had at this time cast their feathers, they could not fly.  They
were of a small kind, and much inferior in size to those that frequent
the vicinity of Athabasca.  At eight, we took our station near an Indian
encampment, and, as we had observed in similar situations, pieces of
bone, rein-deer's horn, &amp;c., were scattered about it.  It also
appeared, that the natives had been
employed  here in
working wood into arms, utensils, &amp;c.</p>

<br/><p><i>Monday, 20.</i>—We embarked at three this morning, when
the weather was cloudy, with small rain and aft wind.  About twelve the
rain became so violent as to compel us to encamp at two in the
afternoon.  We saw great numbers of fowl, and killed among us fifteen
geese and four swans.  Had the weather been more favourable, we should
have added considerably to our booty.  We now passed the river, where we
expected to meet some of the natives, but discovered no signs of them.
The ground close to the river does not rise to any considerable height,
and the hills, which are at a small distance, are covered with the
spruce fir and small birch trees, to their very summits.</p>

<br/><p><i>Tuesday, 21.</i>—We embarked at half past one this
morning, when the weather was cold and unpleasant, and the wind
South-West.  At ten, we left the channels formed by the islands for the
uninterrupted channel of the river, where we found the current so
strong, that it was absolutely necessary to tow the canoe with a line.
The land on both sides was elevated, and almost perpendicular, and the
shore beneath it, which is of no great breadth, was covered with a grey
stone that falls from the precipice.  We made much greater expedition
with the line than we
 could have done
with the paddles.  The men in the canoe relieved two of those on shore
every two hours, so that it was very hard and fatiguing duty, but it
saved a great deal of that time which was so precious to us.  At half
past eight we landed at the same spot where we had already encamped on
the ninth instant.</p>

<p>In about an hour after our arrival, we were joined by eleven of the
natives, who were stationed farther up the river, and there were some
among them whom we had not seen during our former visit to this place.
The brother of our late guide, however, was of the party, and was eager
in his inquiries after him; but our account did not prove satisfactory.
They all gave evident tokens of their suspicion, and each of them made a
distinct harangue on the occasion.  Our Indians, indeed, did not
understand their eloquence, though they conjectured it to be very
unfavourable to our assertions.  The brother, nevertheless, proposed to
barter his credulity for a small quantity of beads, and promised to
believe every thing I should say, if I would gratify him with a few of
those baubles; but he did not succeed in his proposition, and I
contented myself with giving him the bow and arrows which our conductor
had left with us.</p>

<p>My people were now necessarily engaged in putting the fire-arms in
order, after the violent rain of the preceding day; an employment which
very much attracted the curiosity, and appeared in some degree, to
awaken the apprehensions of the natives.  To their inquiries concerning
the motives of our preparation, we answered by showing a piece of meat
and a goose, and informing them, that we were preparing our arms to
procure similar provisions: at the same time we assured them, though it
was our intention to kill any animals we might find, there was no
intention to hurt or injure them.  They, however, entreated us not to
discharge our pieces in their presence.  I requested the English chief
to ask them some questions, which they either did not or would not
understand; so that I failed in obtaining any information from them.</p>

<p>All my people went to rest; but I thought it prudent to sit up, in order
to watch the motions of the natives.  This circumstance was a subject of
their inquiry; and their curiosity was still more excited, when they saw
me employed in writing.  About twelve o'clock I perceived four of their
women coming along the shore; and they were no sooner seen by their
friends, than they ran hastily to meet them, and persuaded two of them,
who, I suppose, were young, to return, while they brought the other two,
who were very 
old, to enjoy the warmth of our fire; but, after staying
there for about half an hour, they also retreated.  Those who remained,
immediately kindled a small fire, and laid themselves down to sleep
round it, like so many whelps, having neither skins or garments of any
kind to cover them, notwithstanding the cold that prevailed.  My people
having placed their kettle of meat on the fire, I was obliged to guard
it from the natives, who made several attempts to possess themselves of
its contents; and this was the only instance I had hitherto discovered,
of their being influenced by a pilfering disposition.  It might,
perhaps, be a general opinion, that provisions were a common property.
I now saw the sun set for the first time since I had been here before.
During the preceding night, the weather was so cloudy, that I could not
observe its descent to the horizon.  The water had sunk, at this place,
upward of three feet since we had passed down the river.</p>

<br/><p><i>Wednesday, 22.</i>—We began our march at half past three
this morning, the men being employed to tow the canoe.  I walked with
the Indians to their huts, which were at a greater distance than I had
any reason to expect, for it occupied three hours in hard walking to
reach them.  We passed a narrow, and deep river in our way, at the mouth
of which the natives had set their nets.  They had
hid their effects,
and sent their young women into the woods, as we saw but very few of the
former, and none of the latter.  They had large huts built with
drift-wood on the declivity of the beach and in the inside the earth was
dug away, so as to form a level floor.  At each end was a stout fork,
whereon was laid a strong ridge-pole, which formed a support to the
whole structure, and at covering of spruce bark preserved it from the
rain.  Various spars of different heights were fixed within the hut, and
covered with split fish that hung on them to dry; and fires were made in
different parts to accelerate the operation.  There were rails also on
the outside of the building, which were hung around with fish, but in a
fresher state than those within.  The spawn is also carefully preserved
and dried in the same manner.  We obtained as many fish from them as the
canoe could conveniently contain, and some strings of beads were the
price paid for them, an article which they preferred to every other.
Iron they held in little or no estimation.</p>

<p>During the two hours that I remained here, I employed the English chief
in a continual state of inquiry concerning these people.  The
information that resulted from this conference was as follows:</p>

<p>This nation or tribe is very numerous, with whom the Esquimaux had been
continually at variance,
a people who take every advantage of attacking
those who are not in a state to defend themselves; and though they had
promised friendship, had lately, and in the most treacherous manner,
butchered some of their people.  As a proof of this circumstance, the
relations of the deceased showed us, that they had cut off their hair on
the occasion.  They also declared their determination to withdraw all
confidence in future from the Esquimaux, and to collect themselves in a
formidable body, that they might be enabled to revenge the death of
their friends.</p>

<p>From their account, a strong party of Esquimaux occasionally ascends
this river, in large canoes, in search of flint stones, which they
employ to point their spears and arrows.  They were now at their lake
due East from the spot where we then were, which was at no great
distance over land, where they kill the rein-deer, and that they would
soon begin to catch big fish for the winter stock.  We could not,
however, obtain any information respecting the lake in the direction in
which we were.  To the Eastward and Westward where they saw it, the ice
breaks up, but soon freezes again.</p>

<p>The Esquimaux informed them that they saw large canoes full of white
men to the Westward, eight or ten winters ago, from whom they obtained
iron in exchange for
 leather.  The
lake where they met these canoes, is called by them <i>Belhoullay
Toe</i>, or White Man's Lake.  They also represented the Esquimaux as
dressing like themselves.  They wear their hair short, and have two
holes perforated, one on each side of the mouth, in a line with the
under lip, in which they place long beads that they find in the lake.
Their bows are somewhat different from those used by the natives we had
seen, and they employ slings from whence they throw stones with such
dexterity that they prove very formidable weapons in the day of
battle.</p>

<p>We also learned in addition from the natives, that we should not see any
more of their relations, as they had all left the river to go in pursuit
of rein-deer for their provisions, and that they themselves should
engage in a similar expedition in a few days.  Rein-deer, bears,
wolverines, martens, foxes, hares, and white buffaloes are the only
quadrupeds in their country; and that the latter were only to be found
in the mountains to the Westward.</p>

<p>We proceeded with the line throughout the day, except two hours, when we
employed the sail.  We encamped at eight in the evening.  From the place
we quitted this morning, the banks of the river are well covered with
small wood, spruce, firs, birch, and willow.  We found it very warm
during the whole of our progress.</p>

<br/><p><i>Thursday, 23.</i>—At five in the morning we proceeded on
our voyage, but found it very difficult to travel along the beach.  We
observed several places where the natives had stationed themselves and
set their nets since our passage downwards.  We passed a small river,
and at five o'clock our Indians put to shore in order to encamp, but we
proceeded onwards, which displeased them very much, from the fatigue
they suffered, and at eight we encamped at our position of the 8th
instant.  The day was very fine, and we employed the towing line
throughout the course of it.  At ten, our hunters returned, sullen and
dissatisfied.  We had not touched any of our provision stores for six
days, in which time we had consumed two rein-deer, four swans,
forty-five geese, and a considerable quantity of fish: but it is to be
considered, that we were ten men, and four women.  I have always
observed, that the north men possessed very hearty appetites, but they
were very much exceeded by those with me since we entered this river.  I
should really have thought it absolute gluttony in my people, if my own
appetite had not increased in a similar proportion.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="chap5-r1" href="#chap5-l1">[1]</a> The longitude
has since been discovered, by the dead reckoning, to be 135. West.</p>

<br/>

<h4><a name="chapter6" href="#toc_chapter6"> CHAPTER VI.</a>
</h4>

<p class="noindent">JULY, 1789.</p>
<p><i>Friday, 24.</i>—At five we continued our course, but, in a
very short time, were under the necessity of applying to the aid of the
line, the stream being so strong as to render all our attempts
unavailing to stem it with the paddles.  We passed a small river, on
each side of which the natives and Esquimaux collect flint.  The bank is
an high, steep, and soft rock, variegated with red, green, and yellow
hues.  From the continual dripping of water, parts of it frequently fall
and break into small stony flakes like slate, but not so hard.  Among
them are found pieces of <i>Petrolium</i>, which bears a resemblance to
yellow wax, but is more friable.  The English chief informed me that
rocks of a similar kind are scattered about the country at the back of
the Slave Lake, where the Chepewyans collect copper.</p>

<p>At ten, we had an aft wind, and the men who had been engaged in
towing, re-embarked.  At twelve, we observed a lodge on the side of the
river, and its inhabitants running about in great confusion, or hurrying
to the woods.  Three men waited our
arrival,  though
they remained at some distance from us, with their bows and arrows ready
to be employed; or at least, that appeared to be the idea they wished to
convey to us, by continually snapping the strings of the former, and the
signs they made to forbid our approach.  The English chief, whose
language they, in some degree understood, endeavoured to remove their
distrust of us; but till I went to them with a present of beads, they
refused to have any communication with us.</p>

<p>When they first perceived our sail, they took us for the Esquimaux
Indians, who employ a sail in their canoes.  They were suspicious of our
designs, and questioned us with a view to obtain some knowledge of them.
On seeing us in possession of some of the clothes, bows, etc., which
must have belonged to some of the Deguthee Denees, or Quarrellers, they
imagined that we had killed some of them, and were bearing away the
fruits of our victory.  They appeared, indeed, to be of the same tribe,
though they were afraid of acknowledging it.  From their questions, it
was evident that they had not received any notice of our being in those
parts.</p>

<p>They would not acknowledge that they had any women with them, though we
had seen them running to the woods; but pretended that they had been
left at a considerable 
distance from the river, with some relations, who
were engaged in killing rein-deer.  These people had been here but a
short time, and their lodge was not yet completed; nor had they any fish
in a state of preparation for their provision.  I gave them a knife and
some beads for an horn-wedge or chisel, with which they split their
canoe-wood.  One of my Indians having broken his paddle, attempted to
take one of theirs, which was immediately contested by its owner, and on
my interfering to prevent this act of injustice, he manifested his
gratitude to me on the occasion.  We lost an hour and a half in this
conference.</p>

<p>The English chief was during the whole of the time in the woods, where
some of the hidden property was discovered, but the women contrived to
elude the search that was made after them.  Some of these articles were
purloined, but I was ignorant of this circumstance till we had taken our
departure, or I should have given an ample remuneration.  Our chief
expressed his displeasure at their running away to conceal themselves,
their property, and their young women, in very bitter terms.  He said
his heart was against those slaves; and complained aloud of his
disappointment in coming so far without seeing the natives, and getting
something from them.</p>

<p>We employed
the sail and the paddle since ten this morning, and pitched
our tents at seven in the evening.  We had no sooner encamped than we
were visited by an Indian whom we had seen before, and whose family was
at a small distance up the river: at nine he left us.  The weather was
clear and serene.</p>

<br/><p><i>Saturday, 25.</i>—We embarked this morning at a quarter
past three, and at seven we passed the lodge of the Indian who had
visited us the preceding evening.  There appeared to have been more than
one family, and we naturally concluded that our visitor had made such an
unfavourable report of us, as to induce his companions to fly on our
approach.  Their fire was not extinguished, and they had left a
considerable quantity of fish scattered about their dwelling.</p>

<p>The weather was now very sultry; but the current had relaxed of its
force, so that the paddle was sufficient for our progress during the
greatest part of the day.  The inland part of the country is mountainous
and the banks of the river low, but covered with wood, among which is
the poplar, but of small growth, and the first which we had seen on our
return.  A pigeon also flew by us, and hares appeared to be in great
plenty.  We passed many Indian encampments which we did not see in our
passage down the river.  
About seven the sky, to the Westward, became of
a steel blue colour, with lightning and thunder.  We accordingly landed
to prepare ourselves against the coming storm; but before we could erect
our tents, it came on with such violence that we expected it to carry
every thing before it.  The ridgepole of my tent was broken in the
middle, where it was sound, and nine inches and an half in
circumference; and we were obliged to throw ourselves flat on the ground
to escape being wounded by the stones that were hurled about in the air
like sand.  The violence of the storm, however, subsided in a short
time, but left the sky overcast with the appearance of rain.</p>

<br/><p><i>Sunday, 26.</i>—It rained from the preceding evening to
this morning, when we embarked at four o'clock.  At eight we landed at
three large Indian lodges.  Their inhabitants, who were asleep,
expressed uncommon alarm and agitation when they were awakened by us,
though most of them had seen us before.  Their habitations were crowded
with fish, hanging to dry in every part; but as we wanted some for
present use, we sent their young men to visit the nets, and they
returned with abundance of large white fish, to which the name has been
given of <i>poisson inconnu</i>; some of a round shape, and green
colour; and a few white ones; all which
were  very
agreeable food.  Some beads, and a few other trifles, were gratefully
received in return.  These people are very fond of iron work of any
kind, and my men purchased several of their articles for small pieces of
tin.</p>

<p>There were five or six persons whom we had not seen before; and among
them was a Dog-rib Indian, whom some private quarrel had driven from his
country.  The English chief understood him as well as one of his own
nation, and gave the following account of their conversation:—</p>

<p>He had been informed by the people with whom he now lives, the Hare
Indians, that there is another river on the other side of the mountains
to the South-West, which falls into the <i>Belhoullay Teo</i>, or
White-man's Lake, in comparison of which that on whose banks we then
were, was but a small stream; that the natives were very large, and very
wicked, and kill common men with their eyes; that they make canoes
larger than ours; that those who inhabit the entrance of it kill a kind
of beaver, the skin of which is almost red; and that large canoes often
frequent it.  As there is no known communication by water with this
river, the natives who saw it went over the mountains.</p>

<p>As he mentioned that there were some beavers in this part of the
country, I told him 
to hunt it, and desire the others to do the same, as
well as the martens, foxes, beaver-eater or wolverine, &amp;c., which they
might carry to barter for iron with his own nation, who are supplied
with goods by us, near their country.  He was anxious to know whether
`we should return that way; at the same time he informed us, that we
should see but few of the natives along the river, as all the young men
were engaged in killing rein-deer, near the Esquimaux Lake, which, he
also said, was at no great distance.  The latter he represented as very
treacherous, and added, that they had killed one of his people.  He told
us likewise, that some plan of revenge was meditating, unless the
offending party paid a sufficient price for the body of the murdered
person.</p>

<p>My Indians were very anxious to possess themselves of a woman that was
with the natives, but as they were not willing to part with her, I
interfered, to prevent her being taken by force; indeed, I was obliged
to exercise the utmost vigilance, as the Indians who accompanied me were
ever ready to take what they could from the natives, without making them
any return.  About twelve, we passed a river of some appearance, flowing
from the Eastward.  One of the natives who followed us, called it the
Winter Road River.  We did not find the stream strong to-day, along the
shore, as there were many eddy currents; we therefore employed the sail
during some hours of it, and went on shore for the night at half past
seven.</p>

<br/><p><i>Monday, 27.</i>—The weather was now fine, and we renewed our
voyage at half past two.  At seven we landed where there were three families,
situated close to the rapids.  We found but few people; for as the
Indian who followed us yesterday had arrived here before us, we supposed
that the greater part had fled, on the intelligence which he gave of our
approach.  Some of these people we had seen before, when they told us
that they had left their property at a lake in the neighbourhood, and
had promised to fetch it before our return; but we now found them as
unprovided as when we left them.  They had plenty of fish, some of which
was packed up in birch bark.</p>

<p>During the time we remained with them, which was not more than two
hours, I endeavoured to obtain some additional intelligence respecting
the river which had been mentioned on the preceding day; when they
declared their total ignorance of it, but from the reports of others, as
they had never been beyond the mountains, on the opposite side of their
own river; they had, however, been informed that it was larger than that
which washed the banks whereon they lived, and
 that its
course was towards the mid-day sun.  They added, that there were people
at a small distance up the river, who inhabited the opposite mountains,
and had lately descended from them to obtain supplies of fish.  These
people, they suggested, must be well acquainted with the other river,
which was the object of my inquiry.  I engaged one of them, by a bribe
of some beads, to describe the circumjacent country upon the sand.  This
singular map he immediately undertook to delineate, and accordingly
traced out a very long point of land between the rivers, though without
paying the least attention to their courses, which he represented as
running into the great lake, at the extremity of which, as he had been
told by Indians of other nations, there was a Belhoullay Couin, or White
Man's Fort.  This I took to be Unalascha Fort, and consequently the
river to the West to be Cook's River; and that the body of water or sea
into which this river discharges itself at Whale Island, communicates
with Norton Sound.  I made an advantageous proposition to this man to
accompany me across the mountains to the other river, but he refused it.
At the same time he recommended me to the people already mentioned, who
were fishing in the neighbourhood, as better qualified to assist me in
the undertaking which I had proposed.</p>

<p>One of this small
company of natives was grievously afflicted with
ulcers in his back, and the only attention which was paid to his
miserable condition, as far at least as we could discover, proceeded
from a woman, who carefully employed a bunch of feathers in preventing
the flies from settling upon his sores.</p>

<p>At ten this morning we landed near the lodges which had already been
mentioned to us, and I ordered my people to make preparation for passing
the remaining part of the day here, in order to obtain that familiarity
with the natives which might induce them to afford me, without reserve,
the information that I should require from them.  This object, however,
was in danger of being altogether frustrated, by a misunderstanding that
had taken place between the natives and my young Indians, who had
already arrived there.  Before the latter could disembark, the former
seized the canoe, and dragged it on shore, and in this act of violence
the boat was broken, from the weight of the persons in it.  This insult
was on the point of being seriously revenged, when I arrived, to prevent
the consequences of such a disposition.  The variation of the compass
was about twenty-nine degrees to the East.</p>

<p>At four in the afternoon I ordered my interpreter to harangue the
natives, assembled 
in council; but his long discourse obtained little
satisfactory intelligence from them.  Their account of the river to the
Westward, was similar to that which he had already received: and their
description of the inhabitants of that country was still more absurd and
ridiculous.  They represented them as being of a gigantic stature, and
adorned with wings; which, however, they never employed in flying.  That
they fed on large birds, which they killed with the greatest ease,
though common men would be certain victims of their ferocity if they
ventured to approach them.  They also described the people that
inhabited the mouth of the river as possessing the extraordinary power
of killing with their eyes, and devouring a large beaver at a single
meal.  They added that canoes of very large dimensions visited that
place.  They did not, however, relate these strange circumstances from
their own knowledge, but on the reports of other tribes, as they
themselves never ventured to proceed beyond the first mountains, where
they went in search of the small white buffaloes, as the inhabitants of
the other side endeavour to kill them whenever they meet.  They likewise
mentioned that the sources of those streams which are tributary to both
the great rivers are separated by the mountains.  It appeared to us,
however, that these people knew more about the country than they chose

to communicate, or at least reached me, as the interpreter, who had long
been tired of the voyage, might conceal such a part of their
communications as, in his opinion, would induce me to follow new routes,
or extend my excursions.</p>

<p>No sooner was the conference concluded, than they began to dance, which
is their favourite, and, except jumping, their only amusement.  In this
pastime old and young, male and female, continued their exertions, till
their strength was exhausted.  This exercise was accompanied by loud
imitations of the various noises produced by the rein-deer, the bear,
and the wolf.  When they had finished their antics, I desired the
English chief to renew the former subjects; which he did without
success.  I therefore assumed an angry air, expressed my suspicions that
they withheld their information, and concluded with a menace, that if
they did not give me all the satisfaction in their power, I would force
one of them along with me to-morrow, to point out the other river.  On
this declaration, they all, at one and the same moment, became sick, and
answered in a very faint tone, that they knew no more than they had
already communicated, and that they should die if I took any of them
away.  They began to persuade my interpreter to remain with them, as
they loved 
him as well as they did themselves, and that he would be
killed if he continued with me.  Nor did this proposition, aided as it
was by the solicitation of his women, fail of producing a considerable
effect upon him, though he endeavoured to conceal it from me.</p>

<p>I now found that it would be fruitless for me to expect any accounts of
the country, or the other great river, till I got to the river of the
Bear Lake, where I expected to find some of the natives, who promised to
wait for us there.  These people had actually mentioned this river to me
when we passed them, but I then paid no attention to that circumstance,
as I imagined it to be either a misunderstanding of my interpreter, or
that it was an invention which, with their other lies, might tend to
prevent me from proceeding down their river.</p>

<p>We were plentifully supplied with fish, as well dry as fresh, by these
people; they also gathered as many hurtle-berries as we chose, for which
we paid with the usual articles of beads, awls, knives, and tin.  I
purchased a few beaver-skins of them, which, according to their
accounts, are not very numerous in this country; and that they do not
abound in moose-deer and buffaloes.  They were alarmed for some of their
young men, who were killing geese higher up the river, and entreated us
to do them no harm.  About sunset I was under the necessity of shooting
one of their dogs, as we could not keep those animals from our baggage.
It was in vain that I had remonstrated on this subject, so that I was
obliged to commit the act which has been just mentioned.  When these
people heard the report of the pistol, and saw the dog dead, they were
seized with a very general alarm, and the women took their children on
their backs and ran into the woods.  I ordered the cause of this act of
severity to be explained, with the assurance that no injury would be
offered to themselves.  The woman, however, to whom the dog belonged,
was very much affected, and declared that the loss of five children,
during the preceding winter, had not affected her so much as the death
of this animal.  But her grief was not of very long duration; and a few
beads, &amp;c., soon assuaged her sorrow.  But as they can without
difficulty get rid of their affliction, they can with equal ease assume
it, and feign sickness if it be necessary with the same versatility.
When we arrived this morning, we found the women in tears, from an
apprehension that we were come to take them away.  To the eye of an
European they certainly were objects of disgust; but there were those
among my party who observed some hidden charms in these females which
rendered them objects of desire, and means were found, I believe, that very soon dissipated their
alarms and subdued their coyness.</p>

<p>On the upper part of the beach, liquorice grew in great abundance and it
was now in blossom.  I pulled up some of the roots, which were large and
long; but the natives were ignorant of its qualities, and considered it
as a weed of no use or value.</p>

<br/><p><i>Tuesday, 28.</i>—At four this morning I ordered my
people to prepare for our departure; and while they were loading the
canoe, I went with the English chief to visit the lodges, but the
greater part of their inhabitants had quitted them during the night, and
those that remained pretended sickness and refused to rise.  When,
however, they were convinced that we did not mean to take any of them
with us, their sickness abandoned them, and when we had embarked, they
came forth from their huts, to desire that we would visit their nets,
which were at a small distance up the river, and take all the fish we
might find in them.  We accordingly availed ourselves of this
permission, and took as many as were necessary for our own supply.</p>

<p>We landed shortly after where there were two more lodges, which were
full of fish, but without any inhabitants, who were probably with the
natives whom we had just left.  My Indians, in rummaging these places,
found several articles which they proposed to take; I therefore gave
beads and awls to be left as the purchase of them; but this act of
justice they were not able to comprehend, as the people themselves were
not present.  I took up a net and left a large knife in the place of it.
It was about four fathoms long, and thirty-two meshes in depth; these
nets are much more convenient to set in the eddy current than our long
ones.  This is the place that the Indians call a rapid, though we went
up it all the way with the paddle; so that the current could not be so
strong here, as in many other parts of the river; indeed, if it were so,
the difficulty of towing would be almost insuperable, as in many parts,
the rocks, which are of a great height, and rather project over the
water, leave no shore between them and the stream.  These precipices
abound in swallows' nests.  The weather was now very sultry, and at
eleven we were under the necessity of landing to gum our canoe.</p>

<p>In about an hour we set forward, and at one in the afternoon, went on
shore at a fire, which we supposed to have been kindled by the young
men, who, as we had been already informed, were hunting geese.  Our
hunters found their canoe and the fowl they had got, secreted in the
woods; and soon after, the people themselves, whom they brought to the
water side.  Out of two hundred geese, we picked thirty-six which were
eatable; the 
rest were putrid, and emitted a horrid stench.  They had
been killed some time without having been gutted, and in this state of
loathsome rottenness, we have every reason to suppose they are eaten by
the natives.  We paid for those which we had taken, and departed.  At
seven in the evening, the weather became cloudy and overcast; at eight
we encamped; at nine it began to thunder with great violence; a heavy
rain succeeded, accompanied with a hurricane, that blew down our tents,
and threatened to carry away the canoe, which had been fastened to some
trees with a cod-line.  The storm lasted two hours, and deluged us with
wet.</p>

<br/><p><i>Wednesday, 29.</i>—Yesterday the weather was cloudy, and
the heat insupportable; and now we could not put on clothes enough to
keep us warm.  We embarked at a quarter past four with an aft wind,
which drove us on at a great rate, though the current is very strong.
At ten we came to the other rapid, which we got up with the line on the
West side, where we found it much stronger than when we went down; the
water had also fallen at least five feet since that time, so that
several shoals appeared in the river which we had not seen before, One
of my hunters narrowly escaped being drowned in crossing a river that
falls in from the Westward, and is the most considerable, except the
mountain river,
that flows in this direction.  We had strong Northerly and cold wind
throughout the whole of the day, and took our station for the night at a
quarter past eight.  We killed a goose and caught some young ones.</p>

<br/><p><i>Thursday, 30.</i>—We renewed our voyage at four this morning,
after a very rainy night.  The weather was cloudy, but the cold had moderated,
and the wind was North-West.  We were enabled to employ the sail during
part of the day, and encamped at about seven in the evening.  We killed
eleven old geese and forty young ones which had just begun to fly.  The
English chief was very much irritated against one of his young men: that
jealousy occasioned this uneasiness, and that it was not without very
sufficient cause, was all I could discover.  For the last two or three
days we had eaten the liquorice root, of which there is a great
abundance on the banks of the river.  We found it a powerful astringent.</p>

<br/><p><i>Friday, 31.</i>—The rain was continual throughout the
night, and did not subside till nine this morning, when we renewed our
progress.  The wind and weather the same as yesterday.  About three in
the afternoon it cleared up and the wind died away, when it became warm.
At five the wind veered to the East, and brought cold along with it.
There were plenty of whortle
berries, 
raspberries, and a berry called <i>poire</i>, which grows in the
greatest abundance.  We were very much impeded in our way by shoals of
sand and small stones which render the water shallow at a distance from
the shore.  In other places the bank of the river is lofty: it is formed
of black earth and sand, and, as it is continually falling, displayed to
us, in some parts, a face of solid ice, to within a foot of the surface.
We finished this day's voyage at a quarter before eight, and in the
course of it killed seven geese.</p>

<p>We now had recourse to our corn, for we had only consumed three days of
our original provision since we began to mount the current.  It was my
intention to have ascended the river on the South side from the last
rapid, to discover if there were any rivers of consequence that flow
from the Westward; but the sand-banks were so numerous and the current
so strong, that I was compelled to traverse to the opposite side, where
the eddy currents are very frequent, which gave us an opportunity of
setting our nets and making much more headway.</p>

<p class="noindent">AUGUST, 1789.
</p>
<p><i>Saturday, 1.</i>—We embarked at three this morning, the
weather being clear and cold, with the wind at South-East.  At three in
the afternoon we traversed and landed to take the canoe in tow: here was
an encampment of the natives, which we had reason to suppose they had
quitted the preceding day.  At five we perceived a family, consisting of
a man, two women, and as many children, stationed by the side of the
water, whom we had not seen before.  They informed us, that they had but
few fish, and that none of their friends were in the neighbourhood,
except the inhabitants of one lodge on the other side of the river, and
a man who belonged to them, and who was now occupied in hunting.  I now
found my interpreter very unwilling to ask such questions as were
dictated to him, from the apprehension, as I imagined, that I might
obtain such intelligence as would prevent him from seeing Athabasca this
season.  We left him with the Indian, and pitched our tents at the same
place where we had passed the night on the fifth of last month.  The
English chief came along with the Indian to our fire; and the latter
informed us that the native who went down part of the river with us had
passed there, and that we should meet with three lodges of his tribe
above the river of the Bear Lake.  Of the river to the Westward he knew
nothing, but from the relation of others.  This was the first night
since our departure from Athabasca, when it was sufficiently dark to
render the stars visible.</p>

<br/><p><i>Sunday, 2.</i>—We set off at three this morning with the
towing-line.  I walked with my Indians, as they went faster than the
canoe, and particularly as I suspected that they wanted to arrive at the
huts of the natives before me.  In our way, I observed several small
springs of mineral water running from the foot of the mountain, and
along the beach I saw several lumps of iron ore.  When we came to the
river of the Bear Lake, I ordered one of the young Indians to wait for
my canoe, and I took my place in their small canoe.  This river is about
two hundred and fifty yards broad at this place, the water clear and of
a greenish colour.  When I landed on the opposite shore, I discovered
that the natives had been there very lately from the print of their feet
in the sand.  We continued walking till five in the afternoon, when we
saw several smokes along the shore.  As we naturally concluded, that
these were certain
indications where we should meet the natives who were the objects of our
search we quickened our pace; but, in our progress, experienced a very
sulphurous smell, and at length discovered that the whole bank was on
fire for a very considerable distance.  It proved to be a coal mine, to
which the fire had communicated from an old Indian encampment.  The
beach was covered with coals, and the English chief gathered some of the
softest he could find, as a black dye; it being the mineral, as he
informed me, with which the natives render their quills black.</p>

<p>Here we waited for the large canoe, which arrived an hour after us.  At
half past ten we saw several Indian marks, which consisted of pieces of
bark fixed on poles, and pointing to the woods, opposite to which is an
old beaten road, that bore the marks of being lately frequented; the
beach also was covered with tracks.  At a small distance were the poles
of five lodges standing; where we landed and unloaded our canoe.  I then
despatched one of my men and two young Indians to see if they could find
any natives within a day's march of us.  I wanted the English chief to
go, but he pleaded fatigue, and that it would be of no use.  This was
the first time he had refused to comply with my desire, and jealousy, I
believe, was the cause of it in the present instance; though I had taken
every precaution
that he should not have cause to be jealous of the
Canadians.  There was not, at this time, the least appearance of snow on
the opposite mountains, though they were almost covered with it, when we
passed before.  Set two nets, and at eleven o'clock at night the men and
Indians returned.  They had been to their first encampment, where there
were four fires, and which had been quitted a short time before; so that
they were obliged to make the circuit of several small lakes, which the
natives cross with their canoes.  This encampment was on the borders of
a lake which was too large for them to venture round it, so that they
did not proceed any further.  They saw several beavers and beaver lodges
in those small lakes.  They killed one of these animals whose fur began
to get long, a sure indication that the fall of the year approaches.
They also saw many old tracks of the moose and reindeer.  This is the
time when the rein-deer leave the plains to come to the woods, as the
mosquitoes begin to disappear; I, therefore, apprehended that we should
not find a single Indian on the river side, as they would be in or about
the mountains setting snares to take them.</p>

<br/><p><i>Monday, 3.</i>—We proceeded with a strong Westerly wind, at
four this morning, the weather being cloudy and cold.  At twelve it
 cleared up and
became fine; the current also increased.  The water had fallen so much
since our passage down the river, that here, as in other places, we
discovered many shoals which were not then visible.  We killed several
geese of a larger size than those which we had generally seen.  Several
Indian encampments were seen along the river, and we landed at eight for
the night.</p>

<br/><p><i>Tuesday, 4.</i>—At four in the morning we renewed our
course, when it was fine and calm.  The night had been cold and a very
heavy dew had fallen.  At nine we were obliged to land in order to gum
the canoe, when the weather became extremely warm.  Numerous tracks of
rein-deer appeared on the side of the river.  At half past five we took
our station for the night, and set the nets.  The current was very
strong all day, and we found it very difficult to walk along the beach,
from the large stones which were scattered over it.</p>

<br/><p><i>Wednesday, 5.</i>—We raised our nets, but had not the
good fortune to take a single fish.  The water was now become so low
that the eddy currents would not admit of setting them.  The current had
not relaxed its strength; and the difficulty of walking along the beach
was continued.  The air was now become so cold; that our exercise,
violent as it was, scarce kept us warm.  We passed several points which
we should not have 
accomplished, if the canoe had been loaded.  We were very much fatigued,
and at six were glad to conclude our toilsome march.  The Indians killed
two geese.  The women, who did not quit the canoe, were continually
employed in making shoes of moose-skin, for the men, as a pair did not
last more than a day.</p>

<br/><p><i>Thursday, 6.</i>—The rain prevented us from proceeding
till half past six, when we had a strong aft wind, which, aided by the
paddles, drove us on at a great rate.  We encamped at six to wait for
our Indians, whom we had not seen since the morning; and at half past
seven they arrived very much dissatisfied with their day's journey.  Two
days had now elapsed since we had seen the least appearance of Indian
habitations.</p>

<br/><p><i>Friday, 7.</i>—We embarked at half past three, and soon
after perceived two rein-deer on the beach before us.  We accordingly
checked our course; but our Indians, in contending who should be the
first to get near these animals, alarmed and lost them.  We, however,
killed a female rein-deer, and from the wounds in her hind legs, it was
supposed that she had been pursued by wolves, who had devoured her young
one: her udder was full of milk, and one of the young Indians poured it
among some boiled corn, which he ate with great delight, esteeming it a
very
 delicious food.
At five in the afternoon we saw an animal running along the beach, but
could not determine whether it was a grey fox or a dog.  In a short
time, we went ashore for the night, at the entrance of a small river, as
I thought there might be some natives in the vicinity of the place.  I
ordered my hunters to put their fusees in order, and gave them
ammunition to proceed on a hunting party the next day; they were also
instructed to discover if there were any natives in the neighbouring
mountains.  I found a small canoe at the edge of the woods, which
contained a paddle and a bow: it had been repaired this spring, and the
workmanship of the bark excelled any that I had yet seen.  We saw
several encampments in the course of the day.  The current of the river
was very strong, and along the points equal to rapids.</p>

<br/><p><i>Saturday, 8.</i>—The rain was very violent throughout
the night, and continued till the afternoon of this day, when the
weather began to clear, with a strong, cold, and Westerly wind.  At
three the Indians proceeded on the hunting expedition, and at eight they
returned without having met with the least success; though they saw
numerous tracks of the rein-deer.  They came to an old beaten road,
which one of them followed for some time; but it did not appear to have
been lately
frequented.  The rain now returned, and continued till the morning.</p>

<br/><p><i>Sunday, 9.</i>—We renewed our voyage at half past three,
the weather being cold and cloudy; but at ten it became clear and
moderate.  We saw another canoe at the outside of the wood, and one of
the Indians killed a dog, which was in a meagre, emaciated condition.
We perceived various places where the natives had made their fires; for
these people reside but a short time near the river, and remove from one
bank to the other, as it suits their purposes.  We saw a path which was
connected with another on the opposite side of the river.  The water had
risen considerably since last night, and there had been a strong current
throughout the day.  At seven we made to the shore and encamped.</p>

<br/><p><i>Monday, 10.</i>—At three this morning we returned to our
canoe; the weather fine and clear, with a light wind from the
South-East.  The Indians were before us in pursuit of game.  At ten we
landed opposite to the mountains which we had passed on the second of
the last month, in order to ascertain the variation of the compass at
this place: but this was accomplished in a very imperfect manner, as I
could not depend on my watch.  One of the hunters joined us here,
fatigued and unsuccessful.  As these mountains are the last of any
considerable magnitude on the
 South-West side of
the river, I ordered my men to cross to that side of it, that I might
ascend one of them.  It was near four in the afternoon when I landed,
and I lost no time in proceeding to the attainment of my object.  I was
accompanied only by a young Indian, as the curiosity of my people was
subdued by the fatigue they had undergone; and we soon had reason to
believe that we should pay dearly for the indulgence of our own.  The
wood, which was chiefly of spruce firs, was so thick that it was with
great difficulty we made our way through it.  When we had walked upwards
of an hour, the under-wood decreased, while the white birch and poplar
were the largest and tallest of their kind that I had ever seen.  The
ground now began to rise, and was covered with small pines, and at
length we got the first view of the mountains since we had left the
canoe; as they appeared to be no nearer to us, though we had been
walking for three hours, than when we had seen them from the river, my
companion expressed a very great anxiety to return; his shoes and
leggins were torn to pieces, and he was alarmed at the idea of passing
through such bad roads during the night.  I persisted, however, in
proceeding, with a determination to pass the night on the mountains and
return on the morrow.  As we approached them, the ground was quite
marshy, and we waded
in water and grass
up to the knees, till we came within a mile of them, when I suddenly
sunk up to my arm-pits, and it was with some difficulty that I
extricated myself from this disagreeable situation.  I now found it
impossible to proceed; to cross this marshy ground in a straight line
was impracticable, and it extended so far to the right and left, that I
could not attempt to make the circuit; I therefore determined to return
to the canoe, and arrived there about midnight, very much fatigued with
this fruitless journey.</p>

<br/><p><i>Tuesday, 11.</i>—We observed several tracks along the
beach, and an encampment at the edge of the woods, which appeared to be
five or six days old.  We should have continued our route along this
side of the river, but we had not seen our hunters since yesterday
morning.  We accordingly embarked before three, and at five traversed
the river, when we saw two of them coming down in search of us.  They
had killed no other animals than one beaver, and a few hares.  According
to their account, the woods were so thick that it was impossible to
follow the game through them.  They had seen several of the natives'
encampments, at no great distance from the river and it was their
opinion that they had discovered us in our passage down it, and had
taken care to avoid us; which accounted for the small number we had seen
on our return.</p>

<p>I requested the
English chief to return with me to the other side of the
river, in order that he might proceed to discover the natives, whose
tracks and habitations we had seen there; but he was backward in
complying with my desire, and proposed to send the young men; but I
could not trust to them, and at the same time was become rather doubtful
of him.  They were still afraid lest I should obtain such accounts of
the other river as would induce me to travel overland to it, and that
they should be called upon to accompany me.  I was, indeed, informed by
one of my own people, that the English chief, his wives and companions,
had determined to leave me on this side of the Slave Lake, in order to
go to the country of the Beaver Indians, and that about the middle of
the winter he would return to that lake, where he had appointed to meet
some of his relations, who, during the last spring, had been engaged in
war.</p>

<p>We now traversed the river, and continued to track the Indians till past
twelve, when we lost all traces of them; in consequence, as we imagined,
of their having crossed to the Eastern side.  We saw several dogs on
both shores; and one of the young Indians killed a wolf, which the men
ate with great satisfaction: we shot, also, fifteen young geese that
were now beginning to fly.  It was eight when we took our evening
station, having 
lost four hours in making our traverses.  There was no
interruption of the fine weather during the course of this day.</p>

<br/><p><i>Wednesday, 12.</i>—We proceeded on our voyage at three
this morning, and despatched the two young Indians across the river,
that we might not miss any of the natives that should be on the banks of
it.  We saw many places where fires had been lately made along the
beach, as well as fire running in the woods.  At four we arrived at an
encampment which had been left this morning.  Their tracks were
observable in several places in the woods, and as it might be presumed
that they could not be at any great distance, it was proposed to the
chief to accompany me in search of them.  We accordingly, though with
some hesitation on his part, penetrated several miles into the woods,
but without discovering the objects of our research.  The fire had
spread all over the country, and had burned about three inches of the
black, light soil, which covered a body of cold clay, that was so hard
as not to receive the least impression of our feet.  At ten we returned
from our unsuccessful excursion.  In the mean time the hunters had
killed seven geese.  There were several showers of rain, accompanied
with gusts of wind and thunder.  The nets had been set during our
absence.</p>

<br/><p><i>Thursday, 13.</i>—The nets were taken up, but not one fish was found in
them; and at half past three we continued our route, with very
favourable weather.  We passed several places, where fires had been made
by the natives, and many tracks were perceptible along the beach.  At
seven we were opposite the island where our pemmican had been concealed:
two of the Indians were accordingly despatched in search of it, and it
proved very acceptable, as it rendered us more independent of the
provisions which were to be obtained by our fowling pieces, and
qualified us to get out of the river without that delay which our
hunters would otherwise have required.  In a short time we perceived a
smoke on the shore to the South-West, at the distance of three leagues,
which did not appear to proceed from any running fire.  The Indians, who
were a little way ahead of us, did not discover it, being engaged in
the pursuit of a flock of geese, at which they fired several shots, when
the smoke immediately disappeared; and in a short time we saw several of
the natives run along the shore, some of whom entered their canoes.
Though we were almost opposite to them, we could not cross the river
without going further up it, from the strength of the current; I
therefore ordered our Indians to make every possible exertion, in order
to speak with them, and wait our arrival.  But as soon as our small
canoe struck off,
we could perceive the poor affrighted people hasten to
the shore, and after drawing their canoes on the beach, hurry into the
woods.  It was past ten before we landed at the place where they had
deserted their canoes, which were four in number.  They were so
terrified that they had left several articles on the beach.  I was very
much displeased with my Indians, who instead of seeking the natives,
were dividing their property.  I rebuked the English chief with some
severity for his conduct, and immediately ordered him, his young men,
and my own people, to go in search of the fugitives, but their fears had
made them too nimble for us, and we could not overtake them.  We saw
several dogs in the woods, and some of them followed us to our canoe.</p>

<p>The English chief was very much displeased at my reproaches, and
expressed himself to me in person to that effect.  This was the very
opportunity which I wanted, to make him acquainted with my
dissatisfaction for some time past.  I stated to him that I had come a
great way, and at a very considerable expense, without having completed
the object of my wishes, and that I suspected he had concealed from me a
principal part of what the natives had told him respecting the country,
lest he should be obliged to follow me: that his reason for not killing
game, &amp;c., was 
his jealousy, which likewise prevented him from looking
after the natives as he ought; and that we had never given him any cause
for any suspicions of us.  These suggestions irritated him in a very
high degree, and he accused me of speaking ill words to him; he denied
the charge of jealousy, and declared that he did not conceal any thing
from us; and that as to the ill success of their hunting, it arose from
the nature of the country, and the scarcity, which had hitherto
appeared, of animals in it.  He concluded by informing me that he would
not accompany me any further: that though he was without ammunition, he
could live in the same manner as the slaves (the name given to the
inhabitants of that part of the country), and that he would remain among
them.  His harangue was succeeded by a loud and bitter lamentation; and
his relations assisted the vociferations of his grief; though they said
that their tears flowed for their dead friends.  I did not interrupt
their grief for two hours, but as I could not well do without them, I
was at length obliged to soothe it, and induce the chief to change his
resolution, which he did, but with great apparent reluctance when we
embarked as we had hitherto done.</p>

<p>The articles which the fugitives had left behind them, on the present
occasion, were bows, arrows, snares for moose and rein-deer, and for
hares; to these may be added a few dishes, made of bark, some skins of
the marten and the beaver, and old beaver robes, with a small robe made
of the skin of the lynx.  Their canoes were coarsely made of the bark of
the spruce-fir, and will carry two or three people.  I ordered my men to
remove them to the shade, and gave most of the other articles to the
young Indians.  The English chief would not accept of any of them.  In
the place, and as the purchase of them, I left some cloth, some small
knives, a file, two fire-steels, a comb, rings, with beads and awls.  I
also ordered a marten skin to be placed on a proper mould, and a beaver
skin to be stretched on a frame, to which I tied a scraper.  The Indians
were of opinion that all these articles would be lost, as the natives
were so much frightened that they would never return.  Here we lost six
hours; and on our quitting the place, three of the dogs which I have
already mentioned followed us along the beach.</p>

<p>We pitched our tents at half past eight, at the entrance of the river of
the mountain; and while the people were unloading the canoe, I took a
walk along the beach, and on the shoals, which being uncovered since we
passed down, by the sinking of the waters, were now white with a saline
substance.  I sent for the English chief to sup with me, and a dram or
two dispelled all his heart-burning and discontent.  He informed me that
it was a custom with the Chepewyan chiefs to go to war after they had
shed tears, in order to wipe away the disgrace attached to such a
feminine weakness, and that in the ensuing spring he should not fail to
execute his design; at the same time he declared his intention to
continue with us as long as I should want him.  I took care that he
should carry some liquid consolation to his lodge, to prevent the return
of his chagrin.  The weather was fine, and the Indians killed three
geese.</p>

<br/><p><i>Friday, 14.</i>—At a quarter before four this morning, we returned to
our canoe, and went about two miles up the river of the mountains.  Fire
was in the ground on each side of it.  In traversing, I took soundings,
and found five, four and an half, and three and an half fathoms water.
Its stream was very muddy, and formed a cloudy streak along the water of
the great river, on the West side to the Eastern rapid, where the waters
of the two rivers at length blend in one.  It was impossible not to
consider it as an extraordinary circumstance, that the current of the
former river should not incorporate with that of the latter, but flow,
as it were, in distinct streams at so great a distance, and till the
contracted state of the channel unites them.  We passed several
encampments of the natives, and a river which flowed in from the North,
that had the appearance of being navigable.  We concluded our voyage of
this day at half past five in the afternoon.  There were plenty of
berries, which my people called <i>poires:</i> they are of a purple hue,
somewhat bigger than a pea, and of a luscious taste; there were also
gooseberries, and a few strawberries.</p>

<br/><p><i>Saturday, 15.</i>—We continued our course from three in the morning
till half past five in the afternoon.  We saw several encampments along
the beach, till it became too narrow to admit them; when the banks rose
into a considerable degree of elevation, and there were more eddy
currents.  The Indians killed twelve geese, and berries were collected
in great abundance.  The weather was sultry throughout the day.</p>

<br/><p><i>Sunday, 16.</i>—We continued our voyage at a quarter
before four, and in five hours passed the place where we had been
stationed on the 13th of June.  Here the river widened, and its shores
became flat.  The land on the North side is low, composed of a black
soil, mixed with stones, but agreeably covered with the aspen, the
poplar, the white birch, the spruce-fir, &amp;c.  The current was so
moderate, that we proceeded upon it almost as fast as in dead water.  At
twelve we passed an encampment of three fires, which was
the  only one we
saw in the course of the day. The weather was the same as yesterday.</p>

<br/><p><i>Monday, 17.</i>—We proceeded at half past three; and saw three
successive encampments.  From the peculiar structure of the huts, we
imagined that some of the Red-Knife Indians had been in this part of the
country, though it is not usual for them to come this way.  I had last
night ordered the young Indians to precede us, for the purpose of
hunting, and at ten we overtook them.  They had killed five young swans;
and the English chief presented us with an eagle, three cranes, a small
beaver, and two geese.  We encamped at seven this evening on the same
spot which had been our resting-place on the 29th of June.</p>

<br/><p><i>Tuesday, 18.</i>—At four this morning I equipped all the
Indians for an hunting excursion, and sent them onward, as our stock of
provision was nearly exhausted.  We followed at half past six, and
crossed over to the North shore, where the land is low and scarcely
visible in the horizon.  It was near twelve when we arrived.  I now got
an observation, when it was 61. 33. North latitude.  We were near five
miles to the North of the main channel of the river.  The fresh tracks
and beds of buffaloes were very perceptible.</p>

<p>Near this place a river flowed in from the Horn Mountains, which are at
no great distance.
We landed at five in the afternoon, and before the
canoe was unloaded, the English chief arrived with the tongue of a cow,
or female buffalo, when four men and the Indians were despatched for the
flesh; but they did not return till it was dark.  They informed me, that
they had seen several human tracks in the sand on the opposite island.
The fine weather continued without interruption.</p>

<br/><p><i>Wednesday, 19.</i>—The Indians were again sent forward
in pursuit of game; and some time being employed in gumming the canoe,
we did not embark till half past five, and at nine we landed to wait the
return of the hunters.  I here found the variation of the compass to be
about twenty degrees East.</p>

<p>The people made themselves paddles and repaired the canoe.  It is an
extraordinary circumstance for which I do not pretend to account, that
there is some peculiar quality in the water of this river, which
corrodes wood, from the destructive effect it had on the paddles.  The
hunters arrived at a late hour, without having seen any large animals.
Their booty consisted only of three swans and as many geese.  The women
were employed in gathering cranberries and crowberries, which were found
in great abundance.</p>

<br/><p><i>Thursday, 20.</i>—We embarked at four o'clock, and took
the North side of
the  channel,
though the current was on that side much stronger, in order to take a
view of the river, which had been mentioned to me in our passage
downwards, as flowing from the country of the Beaver Indians, and which
fell in hereabouts.  We could not, however, discover it, and it is
probable that the account was referable to the river which we had passed
on Tuesday.  The current was very strong, and we crossed over to an
island opposite to us; here it was still more impetuous, and assumed the
hurry of a rapid.  We found an awl and a paddle on the side of the
water; the former we knew to belong to the Knisteneaux: I supposed it to
be the chief Merde-d'ours and his party, who went to war last spring,
and had taken this route on their return to Athabasca.  Nor is it
improbable that they may have been the cause that we saw so few of the
natives on the banks of this river.  The weather was raw and cloudy, and
formed a very unpleasant contrast to the warm, sunny days, which
immediately preceded it.  We took up our abode for the night at half
past seven, on the Northern shore, where the adjacent country is both
low and flat.  The Indians killed live young swans, and a beaver.  There
was an appearance of rain.</p>

<br/><p><i>Friday, 21.</i>—The weather was cold, with a strong
Easterly wind and frequent
showers,  so that
we were detained in our station.  In the afternoon the Indians got on
the track of a moose-deer, but were not so fortunate as to overtake
it.</p>

<br/><p><i>Saturday, 22.</i>—The wind veered round to the Westward,
and continued to blow strong and cold.  We, however, renewed our voyage,
and in three hours reached the entrance of the Slave Lake, under half
sail; with the paddle, it would have taken us at least eight hours.  The
Indians did not arrive till four hours after us; but the wind was so
violent, that it was not expedient to venture into the lake; we
therefore set a net, and encamped for the night.  The women gathered
large quantities of the fruit already mentioned, called Pathagomenan,
and cranberries, crowberries, mooseberries, &amp;c.  The Indians killed
two swans and three geese.</p>

<br/><p><i>Sunday, 23.</i>—The net produced but five small pike,
and at five we embarked, and entered the lake by the same channel
through which we had passed from it.  The South-West side would have
been the shortest, but we were not certain of there being plenty of fish
along the coast, and we were sure of finding abundance of them in the
course we preferred.  Besides, I expected to find my people at the place
where I left them, as they had received orders to remain there till the
fall.</p>

<p>We paddled a long
way into a deep bay to get the wind, and having left
our mast behind us, we landed to cut another.  We then hoisted sail, and
were driven on at a great rate.  At twelve the wind and swell were
augmented to such a degree, that our under yard broke, but luckily the
mast thwart resisted, till we had time to fasten down the yard with a
pole, without lowering sail.  We took in a large quantity of water, and
had our mast given way, in all probability, we should have filled and
sunk.  Our course continued to be very dangerous, along a flat
lee-shore, without being able to land till three in the afternoon.  Two
men were continually employed in bailing out the water which we took in
on all sides.  We fortunately doubled a point that screened us from the
wind and swell, and encamped for the night, in order to wait for our
Indians.  We then set our nets, made a yard and mast, and gummed the
canoe.  On visiting the nets, we found six white fish, and two pike.
The women gathered cranberries and crowberries in great plenty; and as
the night came on, the weather became more moderate.</p>

<br/><p><i>Monday, 24.</i>—Our nets this morning produced fourteen
white fish, ten pikes, and a couple of trouts.  At five we embarked with
a light breeze from the South, when we hoisted sail, and proceeded
slowly, as our
Indians  had not
come up with us.  At eleven we went on shore to prepare the kettle, and
dry the nets; at one we were again on the water.  At four in the
afternoon, we perceived a large canoe with a sail, and two small ones
ahead; we soon came up with them, when they proved to be M. Le Roux and
an Indian, with his family, who were on a hunting party, and had been
out twenty-five days.  It was his intention to have gone as far as the
river, to leave a letter for me, to inform me of his situation.  He had
seen no more Indians where I had left him; but had made a voyage to Lac
la Marte, where he met eighteen small canoes of the Slave Indians, from
whom he obtained five pack of skins, which were principally those of the
marten.  There were four Beaver Indians among them, who had bartered the
greatest part of the above mentioned articles with them, before his
arrival.  They informed him that their relations had more skins, but
that they were afraid to venture with them, though they had been
informed that people were to come with goods to barter for them.  He
gave these people a pair of ice chisels each, and other articles, and
sent them away to conduct their friends to the Slave Lake, where he was
to remain during the succeeding winter.</p>

<p>We set three nets and in a short time caught twenty fish of different
kinds.  In the dusk of the evening, the English chief arrived with a
most pitiful account that he had like to have been drowned in trying to
follow us; and that the other men had also a very narrow escape.  Their
canoe, he said, had broken on the swell, at some distance from the
shore, but as it was flat, they had with his assistance been able to
save themselves.  He added, that he left them lamenting, lest they
should not overtake me, if I did not wait for them; he also expressed
his apprehensions that they would not be able to repair their canoe.
This evening I gave my men some rum to cheer them after their fatigues.</p>

<br/><p><i>Tuesday, 25.</i>—We rose this morning at a late hour,
when we visited the nets, which produced but few fish: my people,
indeed, partook of the stores of M. Le Roux.  At eleven, the young
Indians arrived, and reproached me for having left them so far behind.
They had killed two swans, and brought me one of them.  The wind was
Southerly throughout the day, and too strong for us to depart, as we
were at the foot of a grand traverse.  At noon I had an observation,
which gave 61. 29. North latitude.  Such was the state of the weather,
that we could not visit our nets.  In the afternoon, the sky darkened,
and there was lightning, accompanied with loud claps of
thunder.  The wind
also veered round to the Westward, and blew a hurricane.</p>

<br/><p><i>Wednesday, 26.</i>—It rained throughout the night, and
till eight in the morning, without any alteration in the wind.  The
Indians went on a hunting excursion, but returned altogether without
success in the evening.  One of them was so unfortunate as to miss a
moose-deer.  In the afternoon there were heavy showers, with thunder,
&amp;c.</p>

<br/><p><i>Thursday, 27.</i>—We embarked before four, and hoisted
sail.  At nine we landed to dress victuals, and wait for M. Le Roux and
the Indians.  At eleven, we proceeded with fine and calm weather.  At
four in the afternoon, a light breeze sprang up to the Southward, to
which we spread our sail, and at half past five in the afternoon, went
on shore for the night.  We then set our nets.  The English chief and
his people being quite exhausted with fatigue, he this morning expressed
his desire to remain behind, in order to proceed to the country of the
Beaver Indians, engaging at the same time, that he would return to
Athabasca in the course of the winter.</p>

<br/><p><i>Friday, 28.</i>—It blew very hard throughout the night,
and this morning, so that we found it a business of some difficulty to
get to our nets; our trouble, however, was repaid by a considerable
quantity of white fish, trout, &amp;c.  Towards the afternoon the wind
increased.  Two of
the men who had been gathering berries saw two moose-deer, with the
tracks of buffaloes and rein-deer.  About sunset we heard two shots, and
saw a fire on the opposite side of the bay; we accordingly made a large
fire also, that our position might be determined.  When we were all gone
to bed, we heard the report of a gun very near us, and in a very short
time the English chief presented himself drenched with wet, and in much
apparent confusion informed me that the canoe with his companions was
broken to pieces; and that they had lost their fowling pieces, and the
flesh of a rein-deer, which they had killed this morning.  They were, he
said, at a very short distance from us; and at the same time requested
that fire might be sent to them, as they were starving with cold.  They
and his women, however, soon joined us, and were immediately
accommodated with dry clothes.</p>

<br/><p><i>Saturday, 29.</i>—I sent the Indians on an hunting
party, but they returned without success; and they expressed their
determination not to follow me any further, from their apprehension of
being drowned.</p>

<br/><p><i>Sunday, 30.</i>—We embarked at one this morning, and
took from the nets a large trout, and twenty white fish.  At sunrise a
smart aft breeze sprang up, which wafted us to M. Le Roux's house by two
in the
 afternoon.  It was
late before he and our Indians arrived; when, according to a promise
which I had made the latter, I gave them a plentiful equipment of iron
ware, ammunition, tobacco, &amp;c., as a recompense for the toil and
inconvenience they had sustained with me.</p>

<p>I proposed to the English chief to proceed to the country of the Beaver
Indians, and bring them to dispose of their peltries to M. Le Roux, whom
I intended to leave there the ensuing winter.  He had already engaged to
be at Athabasca, in the month of March next, with plenty of furs.</p>

<br/><p><i>Monday, 31.</i>—I sat up all night to make the necessary
arrangements for the embarkation of this morning, and to prepare
instructions for M. Le Roux.  We obtained some provisions here, and
parted from him at five, with fine calm weather.  It soon, however,
became necessary to land on a small island, to stop the leakage of the
canoe, which had been occasioned by the shot of an arrow under the water
mark, by some Indian children.  While this business was proceeding, we
took the opportunity of dressing some fish.  At twelve, the wind sprang
up from the South-East, which was in the teeth of our direction, so that
our progress was greatly impeded.  I had an observation, which gave
62. 15. North latitude.  We landed at seven in the evening, and pitched
our tents.</p>

<br/><p><i>Tuesday,
1.</i>—We continued our voyage at five in the morning, the weather
calm and fine, and passed the Isle a la Cache about twelve, but could
not perceive the land, which was seen in our former passage.  On passing
the Carreboeuf Islands, at five in the afternoon, we saw land to the
South by West, which we thought was the opposite side of the lake,
stretching away to a great distance.  We landed at half past six in the
evening, when there was thunder, and an appearance of change in the
weather.</p>

<br/><p><i>Wednesday, 2.</i>—It rained and blew hard the latter
part of the night.  At half past five the rain subsided, when we made a
traverse of twelve miles, and took in a good deal of water.  At twelve
it became calm, when I had an observation, which gave 61. 36. North
latitude.  At three in the afternoon, there was a slight breeze from the
Westward which soon increased, when we hoisted sail, and took a traverse
of twenty-four miles, for the point of the old Fort, where we arrived at
seven, and stopped for the night.  This traverse shortened our way three
leagues; indeed we did not expect to have cleared the lake in such a
short time.</p>

<br/><p><i>Thursday, 3.</i>—It blew with great violence throughout
the night, and at four in the morning we embarked, when we did not make
more than five miles three hours,
without  stopping;
notwithstanding we were sheltered from the swell by a long bank.  We now
entered the small river, where the wind could have no effect upon us.
There were frequent showers in the course of the day, and we encamped at
six in the evening.</p>

<br/><p><i>Friday, 4.</i>—The morning was dark and cloudy,
nevertheless we embarked at five; but at ten it cleared up.  We saw a
few fowl, and at seven in the evening, went on shore for the night.</p>

<br/><p><i>Saturday, 5.</i>—The weather continued to be cloudy.  At
five we proceeded, and at eight it began to rain very hard.  In about
half an hour we put to shore, and were detained for the remaining part
of the day.</p>

<br/><p><i>Sunday, 6.</i>—It rained throughout the night, with a
strong North wind.  Numerous flocks of wild fowl passed to the
Southward; at six in the afternoon, the rain, in some measure, subsided,
and we embarked, but it soon returned with renewed violence; we,
nevertheless took the advantage of an aft wind, though it cost us a
complete drenching.  The hunters killed seven, geese, and we pitched our
tents at half past six in the evening.</p>

<br/><p><i>Monday, 7.</i>—We were on the water at five this
morning, with a head wind, accompanied by successive showers.  At three
in the afternoon, we ran the canoe on a stump, and it filled with water
before she could be got
to land.  Two hours
were employed in repairing her, and at seven in the evening, we took our
station for the night.</p>

<br/><p><i>Tuesday, 8.</i>—We renewed our voyage at half past four
in a thick mist which lasted till nine, when it cleared away, and fine
weather succeeded.  At three in the afternoon we came to the first
carrying-place, <i>Portage des Noyes</i>, and encamped at the upper end
of it to dry our clothes, some of which were almost rotten.</p>

<br/><p><i>Wednesday, 9.</i>—We embarked at five in the morning,
and our canoe was damaged on the men's shoulders, who were bearing it
over the carrying-place, called <i>Portage du Chetique</i>.  The guide
repaired her, however, while the other men were employed in carrying the
baggage.  The canoe was `gummed at the carrying-place named
the <i>Portage de la Montagne</i>.  After having passed the
carrying-places, we encamped at the Dog River, at half past four in the
afternoon, in a state of great fatigue.  The canoe was again gummed, and
paddles were made to replace those that had been broken in ascending the
rapids.  A swan was the only animal we killed throughout the day.</p>

<br/><p><i>Thursday, 10.</i>—There was rain and violent wind during
the night: in the morning the former subsided and the latter increased.
At half past five we continued our
course  with a
North-Westerly wind.  At seven we hoisted sail: in the forenoon there
were frequent showers of rain and hail, and in the afternoon two showers
of snow: the wind was at this time very strong, and at six in the
evening we landed at a lodge of Knisteneaux, consisting of three men and
five women and children.  They were on their return from war, and one of
them was very sick: they separated from the rest of their party in the
enemy's country, from absolute hunger.  After this separation, they met
with a family of the hostile tribe, whom they destroyed.  They were
entirely ignorant of the fate of their friends, but imagined that they
had returned to the Peace River, or had perished for want of food.  I
gave medicine to the sick,<a name="chap7-l1" href="#chap7-r1">[1]</a>
and a small portion of ammunition
to  the healthy;
which, indeed, they very much wanted, as they had entirely lived for the
last six months on the produce of their bows and arrows.  They appeared
to have been great sufferers by their expedition.</p>

<br/><p><i>Friday, 11.</i>—It froze hard during the night, and was
very cold throughout the day, with an appearance of snow.  We embarked
at half past four in the morning, and continued our course till six in
the evening, when we landed for the night at our encampment of the third
of June.</p>

<br/><p><i>Saturday, 12.</i>—The weather was cloudy, and also very
cold.  At eight, we embarked with a North-East wind, and entered the
Lake of the Hills.  About ten, the wind veered to the West-ward, and was
as strong as we could bear it with the high sail, so that we arrived at
Chepewyan fort by three o'clock in the afternoon, where we found
Mr. Macleod, with five men busily employed in building a new house.
Here, then, we concluded this voyage, which had occupied the
considerable space of one hundred and two days.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="chap7-r1" href="#chap7-l1">[1]</a> This man
had conceived an idea, that the people with whom he had been at war, had
thrown medicine at him, which had caused his present complaint, and that
he despaired of recovery.  The natives are so superstitious, that this
idea alone was sufficient to kill him.  Of this weakness I took
advantage; and assured him, that if he would never more go to war with
such poor defenceless people, I would cure him.  To this proposition he
readily consented, and on my giving him medicine, which consisted of
Turlington's balsam, mixed in water, I declared that it would lose its
effect, if he was not sincere in the promise that he made me.  In short,
he actually recovered, was true to his engagements, and on all occasions
manifested his gratitude to me.</p>

<h4><a name="chapter8" href="#toc_chapter8"> CHAPTER VIII.</a>
</h4>


<p class="noindent">OCTOBER 10, 1792.</p>

<p>Having made every necessary preparation, I left Fort Chepewyan, to
proceed up the Peace River, I had resolved to go as far as our most
distant settlement, which would occupy the remaining part of the season,
it being the route by which I proposed to attempt my next discovery,
across the mountains from the source of that river; for whatever
distance I could reach this fall, would be a proportionate advancement
of my voyage.</p>

<p>In consequence of this design, I left the establishment of Fort
Chepewyan, in charge of Mr. Roderic Mackenzie, accompanied by two canoes
laden with the necessary articles for trade: we accordingly steered West
for one of the branches that communicates with the Peace River, called
the Pine River; at the entrance of which we waited for the other canoes,
in order to take some supplies from them, as I had reason to apprehend
they would not be able to keep up with us.  We entered the Peace River
at seven in the morning of the 12th, taking a Westerly course.  It is
evident, that all the land between it and the Lake of the Hills, as far
as the Elk River, 
is formed by the quantity of earth and mud, which is
carried down by the streams of those two great rivers.  In this space
there are several lakes.  The Lake Clear Water, which is the deepest,
Lake Vassieu, and the Athabasca Lake, which is the largest of the three,
and whose denomination in the Knisteneaux language implies, a flat, low,
swampy country, subject to inundations.  The two last lakes are now so
shallow, that from the cause just mentioned, there is every reason to
expect, that in a few years they will have exchanged their character,
and become extensive forests.</p>

<p>This country is so level, that, at some seasons, it is entirely
overflowed, which accounts for the periodical influx and reflux of the
waters between the Lake of the Hills and the Peace River.</p>

<p>On the 13th at noon we came to the Peace Point; from which, according to
the report of my interpreter, the river derives its name; it was the
spot where the Knisteneaux and Beaver Indians settled their dispute; the
real name of the river and point being that of the land which was the
object of contention.</p>

<p>When this country was formerly invaded by the Knisteneaux, they found
the Beaver Indians inhabiting the land about Portage la Loche; and the
adjoining tribe were those whom they called slaves.  They drove both

these tribes before them; when the latter proceeded down the river from
the Lake of the Hills, in consequence of which that part of it obtained
the name of the Slave River.  The former proceeded up the river; and
when the Knisteneaux made peace with them, this place was settled to be
the boundary.</p>

<p>We continued our voyage, and I did not find the current so strong in
this river as I had been induced to believe, though this, perhaps, was
not the period to form a correct notion of that circumstance, as well as
of the breadth, the water being very low; so that the stream has not
appeared to me to be in any part that I have seen, more than a quarter
of a mile wide.</p>

<p>The weather was cold and raw, so as to render our progress unpleasant;
at the same time we did not relax in our expedition, and, at three on
the afternoon of the 17th we arrived at the falls.  The river at this
place is about four hundred yards broad, and the fall about twenty feet
high: the first carrying place is eight hundred paces in length, and the
last, which is about a mile onwards, is something more than two-thirds
of that distance.  Here we found several fires, from which circumstance
we concluded, that the canoes destined for this quarter, which left the
fort some days before us, could not be far a-head.  The weather
continued to be very 
cold, and the snow that fell during the night was
several inches deep.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 18th, as soon as we got out of the draught of the
fall, the wind being at North-East, and strong in our favour, we hoisted
sail, which carried us on at a considerable rate against the current,
and passed the Loon River before twelve o'clock; from thence we soon
came along the Grande Isle, at the upper end of which we encamped for
the night.  It now froze very hard: indeed, it had so much the
appearance of winter, that I began to entertain some alarm lest we might
be stopped by the ice: we therefore set off at three o'clock in the
morning of the 19th, and about eight we landed at the Old Establishment.</p>

<p>The passage to this place from Athabasca having been surveyed by
M. Vandrieul, formerly in the Company's service, I did not think it
necessary to give any particular attention to it; I shall, however, just
observe, that the course in general from the Lake of the Hills to the
falls, is Westerly, and as much to the North as the South of it, from
thence it is about West-South-West to this fort.</p>

<p>The country in general is low from our entrance of the river to the
falls, and with the exception of a few open parts covered with grass, it
is clothed with wood.  Where
the  banks are very
low the soil is good, being composed of the sediment of the river and
putrefied leaves and vegetables.  Where they are more elevated, they
display a face of yellowish clay, mixed with small stones.  On a line
with the falls, and on either side of the river, there are said to be
very extensive plains, which afford pasture to numerous herds of
buffaloes Our people a-head slept here last night, and, from their
carelessness, the fire was communicated to and burned down, the large
house, and was proceeding fast to the smaller buildings when we arrived
to extinguish it.</p>

<p>We continued our voyage, the course of the river being South-West by
West one mile and a quarter, South by East one mile, South-West by South
three miles, West by South one mile, South-South-West two miles, South
four miles, South-West seven miles and a half, South by West one mile,
North-North-West two miles and a half, South five miles and a quarter,
South-West one mile and a half, North-East by East three miles and a
half, and South-East by East one mile.</p>

<p>We overtook Mr. Finlay, with his canoes, who was encamped near the
fort of which he was going to take the charge, during the ensuing
winter, and made every necessary preparative for a becoming appearance
on our arrival the following morning.  Although I
had been since the
year 1787, in the Athabasca country, I had never yet seen a single
native of that part of it which we had now reached.</p>

<p>At six o'clock in the morning of the 20th, we landed before the house
amidst the rejoicing and firing of the people, who were animated with
the prospect of again indulging themselves in the luxury of rum, of
which they had been deprived since the beginning of May; as it is a
practice throughout the North-West neither to sell or give any rum to
the natives during the summer.  There was at this time only one chief
with his people, the other two being hourly expected with their bands;
and on the 21st and 22d they all arrived except the war chief and
fifteen men.  As they very soon expressed their desire of the expected
regale, I called them together, to the number of forty-two hunters, or
men capable of bearing arms, to offer some advice, which would be
equally advantageous to them and to us, and I strengthened my admonition
with a nine gallon cask of reduced rum, and a quantity of tobacco.  At
the same time I observed, that as I should not often visit them, I had
instanced a greater degree of liberality than they had been accustomed
to.</p>

<p>The number of people belonging to this establishment amounts to about
three hundred, of which, sixty are hunters.  Although they appear from
their language to be of
the  same stock as
the Chepewyans, they differ from them in appearance, manners, and
customs, as they have adopted those of their former enemies, the
Knisteneaux; they speak their language, as well as cut their hair,
paint, and dress like them, and possess their immoderate fondness for
liquor and tobacco.  This description, however, can be applied only to
the men, as the women are less adorned even than those of the Chepewyan
tribes.  We could not observe, without some degree of surprize, the
contrast between the neat and decent appearance of the men, and the
nastiness of the women.  I am disposed, however, to think, that this
circumstance is generally owing to the extreme submission and abasement
of the latter: for I observed, that one of the chiefs allowed two of his
wives more liberty and familiarity than were accorded to the others, as
well as a more becoming exterior, and their appearance was
proportionably pleasing; I shall, however, take a future opportunity to
speak more at large on this subject.</p>

<p>There were frequent changes of the weather in the course of the day,
and it froze rather hard in the night.  The thickness of the ice in the
morning was a sufficient notice for me to proceed.  I accordingly gave
the natives such good counsel as might influence their behaviour,
communicated my directions to Mr. Findlay for his future conduct, and took my leave
under several vollies of musketry, on the morning of the 23d.  I had
already dispatched my loaded canoes two days before, with directions to
continue their progress without waiting for me.  Our course was
South-South-East one mile and an half, South three quarters; East seven
miles and a half, veering gradually to the West four miles and an half,
South-East by South three miles, South-East three miles and an half,
East-South-East to Long Point three miles, South-West one mile and a
quarter, East by North four miles and three quarters, West three miles
and an half, West-South-West one mile, East by South five miles and a
half, South three miles and three quarters, South-East by South three
miles, East-South-East three miles, East-North-East one mile, when there
was a river that flowed in on the right, East two miles and an half,
East-South-East half a mile, South-East by South seven miles and an
half, South two miles, South-South-East three miles and an half; in the
course of which we passed an island South by West, where a rivulet
flowed in on the right, one mile, East one mile and an half, South five
miles, South-East by South four miles and an half, South-West one mile,
South-East by East four miles and an half, West-South-West half a mile,
South-West six miles
and  three
quarters, South-East by South one mile and an half, South one mile and
an half; South-East by South two miles, South-West three quarters of a
mile, South-East by South two miles and an half, East by South one mile
and three quarters, South two miles, South-East one mile and an half,
South-South-East half a mile, East by South two miles and an half,
North-East three miles, South-West by West short distance to the
establishment of last year, East-North-East four miles, South-South-East
one mile and three quarters, South half a mile, South-East by South
three quarters of a mile, North-East by East one mile, South three
miles, South-South-East one mile and three quarters, South by East four
miles and an half, South-West three miles, South by East two miles,
South by West one mile and an half, South-West two miles, South by West
four miles and an half, South-West one mile and an half, and South by
East three miles.  Here we arrived at the forks of the river; the
Eastern branch appearing to be not more than half the size of the
Western one.  We pursued the latter, in a course South-West by West six
miles, and landed on the first of November at the place which was
designed to be my winter residence: indeed, the weather had been so cold
and disagreeable, that I was more than once apprehensive of our being
stopped by  the
ice, and, after all, it required the utmost exertions of which my men
were capable to prevent it; so that on their arrival they were quite
exhausted.  Nor were their labours at an end, for there was not a single
hut to receive us: it was, however, now in my power to feed and sustain
them in a more comfortable manner.</p>

<p>We found two men here who had been sent forward last spring, for the
purpose of squaring timber for the erection of a house, and cutting
pallisades, &amp;c., to surround it.  With them was the principal chief of
the place, and about seventy men, who had been anxiously waiting for our
arrival, and received us with every mark of satisfaction and regard
which they could express.  If we might judge from the quantity of powder
that was wasted on our arrival, they certainly had not been in want of
ammunition, at least during the summer.</p>

<p>The banks of the river, from the falls, are in general lofty, except at
low woody points, accidentally formed in the manner I have already
mentioned: they also displayed, in all their broken parts, a face of
clay, intermixed with stone; in some places there likewise appeared a
black mould.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1788, a small spot was cleared at the Old
Establishment, which is situated on a bank thirty feet above the level
of the river, and
was sown with turnips, carrots, and parsnips.  The
first grew to a large size, and the others thrived very well.  An
experiment was also made with potatoes and cabbage, the former of which
were successful; but for want of care the latter failed.  The next
winter the person who had undertaken this cultivation, suffered the
potatoes which had been collected for seed, to catch the frost, and none
had been since brought to this place.  There is not the least doubt but
the soil would be very productive, if a proper attention was given to
its preparation.  In the fall of the year 1787, when I first arrived at
Athabasca, Mr. Pond was settled on the banks of the Elk River, where he
remained for three years, and had formed as fine a kitchen garden as I
ever saw in Canada.</p>

<p>In addition to the wood which flourished below the fall, these banks
produce the cypress tree, arrow-wood, and the thorn.  On either side of
the river, though invisible from it, are extensive plains, which abound
in buffaloes, elks, wolves, foxes, and bears.  At a considerable
distance to the Westward, is an immense ridge of high land or mountains,
which take an oblique direction from below the falls, and are inhabited
by great numbers of deer, which are seldom disturbed, but when the
Indians go to hunt the beaver in those parts; and, being tired with the
flesh 
of the latter, vary their food with that of the former.  This
ridge bears the name of the Deer Mountain.  Opposite to our present
situation, are beautiful meadows, with various animals grazing on them,
and groves of poplars irregularly scattered over them.</p>

<p>My tent was no sooner pitched, than I summoned the Indians together, and
gave each of them about four inches of Brazil tobacco, a dram of
spirits, and lighted the pipe.  As they had been very troublesome to my
predecessor, I informed them that I had heard of their misconduct, and
was come among them to inquire into the truth of it.  I added also that
it would be an established rule with me to treat them with kindness, if
their behaviour should be such as to deserve it; but, at the same time,
that I should be equally severe if they failed in those returns which I
had a right to expect from them.  I then presented them with a quantity
of rum, which I recommended to be used with discretion; and added some
tobacco, as a token of peace.  They, in return, made me the fairest
promises; and having expressed the pride they felt on beholding me in
their country, took their leave.</p>

<p>I now proceeded to examine my situation; and it was with great
satisfaction I observed that the two men who had been sent hither some
time before us, to cut and square timber for our future operations, had
employed  the
intervening period with activity and skill.  They had formed a
sufficient quantity of pallisades of eighteen feet long, and seven
inches in diameter, to inclose a square spot of an hundred and twenty
feet; they had also dug a ditch of three feet deep to receive them; and
had prepared timber, planks, &amp;c., for the erection of a house.</p>

<p>I was, however, so much occupied in settling matters with the Indians,
and equipping them for their winter hunting, that I could not give my
attention to any other object, till the 7th, when I set all hands at
work to construct the fort, build the house, and form store houses.  On
the preceding day the river began to run with ice, which we call the
last of the navigation.  On the 11th we had a South-West wind, with
snow.  On the 16th, the ice stopped in the other fork, which was not
above a league from us, across the intervening neck of land.  The water
in this branch continued to flow till the 22d, when it was arrested also
by the frost, so that we had a passage across the river, which would
last to the latter end of the succeeding April.  This was a fortunate
circumstance, as we depended for our support upon what the hunters could
provide for us, and they had been prevented by the running of the ice
from crossing the river.  They now, however, very shortly procured us as
much fresh meat as we 
required, though it was for some time a toilsome
business to my people, for as there was not yet a sufficient quantity of
snow to run sledges, they were under the necessity of loading themselves
with the spoils of the chase.</p>

<p>On the 27th the frost was so severe that the axes of the workmen became
almost as brittle as glass.  The weather was very various until the 2d
of December, when my Farenheit's thermometer was injured by an accident,
which rendered it altogether useless.  The table on page 353, therefore,
from the 16th of November, to this unfortunate circumstance, is the only
correct account of the weather which I can offer.</p>

<p>In this situation, removed from all those ready aids which add so much
to the comfort, and, indeed is a principal characteristic of civilized
life, I was under the necessity of employing my judgment and experience
in accessory circumstances by no means connected with the habits of my
life, or the enterprise in which I was immediately engaged.  I was now
among the people who had no knowledge whatever of remediable application
to those disorders and accidents to which man is liable in every part of
the globe, in the distant wilderness, as in the peopled city.  They had
not the least acquaintance with that primitive medicine, which consists
in an </p><br/>

<p class="noindent">experience of
the healing virtues of herbs and plants, and is
frequently found among uncivilised and savage nations.  This
circumstance now obliged me to be their physician and surgeon, as a
woman with a swelled breast, which had been lacerated with flint stones
for the cure of it, presented herself to my attention, and by
cleanliness, poultices, and healing salve, I succeeded in producing a
cure.  One of my people, also, who was at work in the woods, was
attacked with a sudden pain near the first joint of his thumb, which
disabled him from holding an axe.  On examining his arm, I was
astonished to find a narrow red stripe, about half an inch wide, from
his thumb to his shoulder; the pain was violent, and accompanied with
chilliness and shivering.  This was a case that appeared to be beyond my
skill, but it was necessary to do something towards relieving the mind
of the patient, though I might be unsuccessful in removing his
complaint.  I accordingly prepared a kind of volatile liniment of rum
and soap, with which I ordered his arm to be rubbed, but with little or
no effect.  He was in a raving state throughout the night, and the red
stripe not only increased, but was also accompanied with the appearance
of several blotches on his body, and pains in his stomach; the propriety
of taking some blood from him now occurred to and I ventured, from

absolute necessity, to perform that operation for the first time, and
with an effect that justified the treatment.  The following night
afforded him rest, and in a short time he regained his former health and
activity.</p>

<p>I was very much surprised on walking in the woods at such an inclement
period of the year, to be saluted with the singing of birds, while they
seemed by their vivacity to be actuated by the invigorating power of a
more genial season.  Of these birds the male was something less than the
robin; part of his body is of a delicate fawn colour, and his neck,
breast, and belly, of a deep scarlet; the wings are black, edged with
fawn colour, and two white stripes running across them; the tail is
variegated, and the head crowned with a tuft.  The female is smaller
than the male, and of a fawn colour throughout, except on the neck,
which is enlivened by an hue of glossy yellow.  I have no doubt but they
are constant inhabitants of this climate, as well as some other small
birds which we saw, of a grey colour.


<h4><a name="chapter1" href="#toc_chapter1"> CHAPTER I.</a></h4>

<p class="noindent">DECEMBER 23, 1792.</p>

<p>I this day removed from the tent into the house which had been erected
for me, and set all the men to begin the buildings intended for their
own habitation.  Materials sufficient to erect a range of five houses
for them, of about seventeen by twelve feet, were already collected.  It
would be considered by the inhabitants of a milder climate, as a great
evil, to be exposed to the weather at this rigorous season of the year,
but these people are inured to it, and it is necessary to describe in
some measure the hardships which they undergo without a murmur, in order
to convey a general notion of them.</p>

<p>The men who were new with me, left this place in the beginning of last
May, and went to the Rainy Lake in canoes, laden with packs of fur,
which, from the immense length of the voyage, and other concurring
circumstances, is a most severe trial of patience and perseverance:
there they do not remain a sufficient time for ordinary repose, when
they take a load of goods in exchange, and proceed on their return, in a
great measure, day and night.  They had been arrived near two months,
and, all that time, had been continually engaged in very toilsome
labour, with nothing more than a common shed to protect them from the
frost and snow.  Such is the life which these people lead; and is
continued with unremitting exertion, till their strength is lost in
premature old age.</p>

<p>The Canadians remarked, that the weather we had on the 25th, 26th, and
27th of this month, denoted such as we might expect in the three
succeeding months.  On the 29th, the wind being at North-East, and the
weather calm and cloudy, a rumbling noise was heard in the air like
distant thunder, when the sky cleared away in the South-West; from
whence there blew a perfect hurricane, which lasted till eight.  Soon
after it commenced, the atmosphere became so warm that it dissolved all
the snow on the ground; even the ice was covered with water, and had the
same appearance as when it is breaking up in the spring.  From eight to
nine the weather became calm, but immediately after a wind arose from
the North-East with equal violence, with clouds, rain, and hail, which
continued throughout the night till the evening of the next day, when it
turned to snow.  One of the people who wintered at Fort Dauphin in the
year 1780, when the small pox first appeared there, informed me, that
the weather there was of a similar description.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>January 1, 1793.</i>&mdash;On the first day of January, my people, in
conformity to the usual custom, awoke me at the break of day with the
discharge of fire-arms, with which they congratulated the appearance of
the new year.  In return, they were treated with plenty of spirits, and
when there is any flour, cakes are always added to their regales, which
was the case, on the present occasion.</p>

<p>On my arrival here last fall, I found that one of the young Indians had
lost the use of his right hand by the bursting of a gun, and that his
thumb had been maimed in such a manner as to hang only by a small strip
of flesh.  Indeed, when he was brought to me, his wound was in such an
offensive state, and emitted such a putrid smell, that it required all
the resolution I possessed to examine it.  His friends had done every
thing in their power to relieve him; but as it consisted only in singing
about him, and blowing upon his hand, the wound, as may be well
imagined, had got into the deplorable state in which I found it.  I was
rather alarmed at the difficulty of the case, but as the young man's
life was in a state of hazard, I was determined to risk my surgical
reputation, and accordingly took him under my care.  I immediately
formed a poultice of bark, stripped from the roots of the spruce-fir,
which I applied to the wound, having first washed it with the juice of
the bark: this proved a very painful dressing: in a few days, however,
the wound was clean, and the proud flesh around it destroyed.  I wished
very much in this state of the business to have separated the thumb from
the hand, which I well knew must be effected before the cure could be
performed; but he would not consent to that operation, till, by the
application of vitriol, the flesh by which the thumb was suspended, was
shrivelled almost to a thread.  When I had succeeded in this object, I
perceived that the wound was closing rather faster than I desired.  The
salve I applied on the occasion was made of the Canadian balsam, wax and
tallow dropped from a burning candle into water.  In short, I was so
successful, that about Christmas my patient engaged in a hunting party,
and brought me the tongue of an elk: nor was he finally ungrateful.
When he left me I received the warmest acknowledgments, both from
himself and his relations with whom he departed, for my care of him.  I
certainly did not spare my time or attention on the occasion, as I
regularly dressed his wound three times a day, during the course of a
month.</p>

<p>On the 5th in the morning the weather was calm, clear, and very cold;
the wind blew from the South-West, and in the course of the afternoon it
began to thaw.  I had already observed at Athabasca, that this wind
never failed to bring us clear mild weather, whereas, when it blew from
the opposite quarter, it produced snow.  Here it is much more
perceptible, for if it blows hard South-West for four hours, a thaw is
the consequence, and if the wind is at North-East it brings sleet and
snow.  To this cause it may be attributed, that there is now so little
snow in this part of the world.  These warm winds come off the Pacific
Ocean, which cannot, in a direct line, be very far from us; the distance
being so short, that though they pass over mountains covered with snow,
there is not time for them to cool.</p>

<p>There being several of the natives at the house at this time, one of
them, who had received an account of the death of his father, proceeded
in silence to his lodge, and began to fire off his gun.  As it was
night, and such a noise being so uncommon at such an hour, especially
when it was so often repeated, I sent my interpreter to inquire into the
cause of it, when he was informed by the man himself, that this was a
common custom with them on the death of a near relation, and was a
warning to their friends not to approach, or intrude upon them, as they
were, in consequence of their loss, become careless of life.  The chief,
to whom the deceased person was also related, appeared with his war-cap
on his head, which is only worn on these solemn occasions, or when
preparing for battle, and confirmed to me this singular custom of firing
guns, in order to express their grief for the death of relations and
friends.<a name="v2-c1-hl1" href="#v2-c1-hr1">[1]</a> The women alone indulge in tears on such occasions; the men
considering it as a mark of pusillanimity and a want of fortitude to
betray any personal tokens of sensibility or sorrow.</p>

<p>The Indians informed me, that they had been to hunt at a large lake,
called by the Knisteneaux, the Slave Lake, which derived its name from
that of its original inhabitants, who were called Slaves.  They
represented it as a large body of water, and that it lies about one
hundred and twenty miles due East from this place.  It is well known to
the Knisteneaux, who are among the inhabitants of the plains on the
banks of the Saskatchiwine river; for formerly, when they used to come
to make war in this country, they came in their canoes to that lake, and
left them there; from thence, there is a beaten path all the way to the
Fork, or East branch of this river, which was their war-road.</p>

<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>January 10.</i>&mdash;Among the people who were now here, there were two
Rocky Mountain Indians, who declared, that the people to whom we had
given that denomination, are by no means entitled to it, and that their
country has ever been in the vicinity of our present situation.  They
said, in support of their assertion, that these people were entirely
ignorant of those parts which are adjacent to the mountain, as well as
the navigation of the river; that the Beaver Indians had greatly
encroached upon them, and would soon force them to retire to the foot of
these mountains.  They represented themselves as the only real natives
of that country then with me; and added, that the country, and that part
of the river that intervenes between this place and the mountains, bear
much the same appearance as that around us; that the former abounds with
animals, but that the course of the latter is interrupted, near, and in
the mountains, by successive rapids and considerable falls.  These men
also informed me, that there is another great river towards the midday
sun, whose current runs in that direction, and that the distance from it
is not great across the mountains.</p>

<p>The natives brought me plenty of furs.  The small quantity of snow, at
this time, was particularly favourable for hunting the beaver, as from
this circumstance, those animals could, with greater facility, be traced
from their lodges to their lurking-places.</p>

<p>On the 12th our hunter arrived, having left his mother-in-law, who was
lately become a widow with three small children, and in actual labour of
a fourth.  Her daughter related this circumstance to the women here
without the least appearance of concern, though she represented her as
in a state of great danger, which probably might proceed from her being
abandoned in this unnatural manner.  At the same time without any
apparent consciousness of her own barbarous negligence, if the poor
abandoned woman should die, she would most probably lament her with
great outcries, and, perhaps cut off one or two joints of her fingers as
tokens of her grief.  The Indians, indeed, consider the state of a woman
in labour as among the most trifling occurrences of corporal pain to
which human nature is subject, and they may be, in some measure
justified in this apparent insensibility from the circumstances of that
situation among themselves.  It is by no means uncommon in the hasty
removal of their camps from one position to another, for a woman to be
taken in labour, to deliver herself in her way, without any assistance
or notice from her associates in her journey, and to overtake them
before they complete the arrangements of their evening station, with her
new-born babe on her back.</p>

<p>I was this morning threatened with a very unpleasant event, which,
however, I was fortunately able to control.  Two young Indians being
engaged in one of their games, a dispute ensued, which rose to such a
height, that they drew their knives, and if I had not happened to have
appeared, they would I doubt not, have employed them to very bloody
purposes.  So violent was their rage, that after I had turned them both
out of the house, and severely reprimanded them, they stood in the fort
for at least half an hour, looking at each other with a most vindictive
aspect, and in sullen silence.</p>

<p>The game which produced this state of bitter enmity, is called that of
the Platter, from a principal article of it.  The Indians play at it in
the following manner.</p>

<p>The instruments of it consist of a platter, or dish, made of wood or
bark, and six round or square but flat pieces of metal, wood, or stone,
whose sides or surfaces are of different colours.  These are put into
the dish, and after being for some time shaken together, are thrown into
the air, and received again into the dish with considerable dexterity;
when, by the number that are turned up of the same mark or colour, the
game is regulated.  If there should be equal numbers, the throw is not
reckoned; if two or four, the platter changes hands.</p>

<p>On the 13th, one of these people came to me, and presented in himself a
curious example of Indian superstition.  He requested me to furnish him
with a remedy that might be applied to the joints of his legs and
thighs, of which he had, in a great measure lost the use for five
winters.  This affliction he attributed to his cruelty about that time,
when having found a wolf with two whelps in an old beaver lodge, he set
fire to it and consumed them.</p>

<p>The winter had been so mild, that the swans had but lately left us, and
at this advanced period there was very little snow on the ground: it
was, however, at this time a foot and a half in depth, in the environs
of the establishment below this, which is at the distance of about
seventy leagues.</p>

<p>On the 28th the Indians were now employed in making their snow-shoes, as
the snow had not hitherto fallen in sufficient quantity to render them
necessary.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>February 2.</i>&mdash;The weather now became very cold, and it froze so hard
in the night that my watch stopped; a circumstance that had never
happened to this watch since my residence in the country.</p>

<p>There was a lodge of Indians here, who were absolutely starving with
cold and hunger.  They had lately lost a near relation, and had
according to custom, thrown away every thing belonging to them, and even
exchanged the few articles of raiment which they possessed, in order, as
I presume, to get rid of every thing that may bring the deceased to
their remembrance.  They also destroy every thing belonging to any
deceased person, except what they consign to the grave with the late
owner of them.  We had some difficulty to make them comprehend that the
debts of a man who dies should be discharged, if he left any furs behind
him: but those who understand this principle of justice, and profess to
adhere it, never fail to prevent the appearance of any skins beyond such
as may be necessary to satisfy the debts of their dead relation.</p>

<p>On the 8th I had an observation for the longitude.  In the course of
this day one of my men, who had been some time with the Indians, came to
inform me that one of them had threatened to stab him; and on his
preferring a complaint to the man with whom he now lived, and to whom I
had given him in charge, he replied, that he had been very imprudent to
play and quarrel with the young Indians out of his lodge, where no one
would dare to come and quarrel with him; but that if he had lost his
life where he had been, it would have been the consequence of his own
folly.  Thus, even among these children of nature, it appears that a
man's house is his castle, where the protection of hospitality is
rigidly maintained.</p>

<p>The hard frost which had prevailed from the beginning of February
continued to the 16th of March, when the wind blowing from the
South-West, the weather became mild.</p>

<p>On the 22d a wolf was so bold as to venture among the Indian lodges, and
was very near carrying off a child.</p>

<p>I had another observation of Jupiter and his satellites for the
longitude.  On the 13th some geese were seen, and these birds are always
considered as the harbingers of spring.  On the first of April my
hunters shot five of them.  This was a much earlier period than I ever
remember to have observed the visits of wild fowl in this part of the
world.  The weather had been mild for the last fortnight, and there was
a promise of its continuance.  On the 5th the snow had entirely
disappeared.</p>

<p>At half past four this morning I was awakened to be informed that an
Indian had been killed.  I accordingly hastened to the camp, where I
found two women employed in rolling up the dead body of a man, called
the White Partridge, in a beaver robe, which I had lent him.  He had
received four mortal wounds from a dagger, two within the collar bone,
one in the left breast, and another in the small of the back, with two
cuts across his head.  The murderer, who had been my hunter throughout
the winter, had fled; and it was pretended that several relations of the
deceased were gone in pursuit of him.  The history of this unfortunate
event is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>These two men had been comrades for four years; the murderer had three
wives; and the young man who was killed, becoming enamoured of one of
them, the husband consented to yield her to him, with the reserved power
of claiming her as his property, when it should be his pleasure.</p>

<p>This connection was uninterrupted for near three years, when, whimsical
as it may appear, the husband became jealous, and the public amour was
suspended.  The parties, how ever, made their private assignations,
which caused the woman to be so ill treated by her husband, that the
paramour was determined to take her away by force; and this project
ended in his death.  This is a very common practice among the Indians,
and generally terminates in very serious and fatal quarrels.</p>

<p>In consequence of this event all the Indians went away in great apparent
hurry and confusion, and in the evening not one of them was to be seen
about the fort.</p>

<p>The Beaver and Rocky Mountain Indians, who traded with us in this river,
did not exceed an hundred and fifty men, capable of bearing arms; two
thirds of whom call themselves Beaver Indians.  The latter differ only
from the former, as they have, more or less, imbibed the customs and
manners of the Knisteneaux.  As I have already observed, they are
passionately fond of liquor, and in the moments of their festivity will
barter any thing they have in their possession for it.</p>

<p>Though the Beaver Indians made their peace with the Knisteneaux, at
Peace Point, as already mentioned, yet they did not secure a state of
amity from others of the same nation, who had driven away the natives of
the Saskatchiwine and Missinipy Rivers, and joined at the head water of
the latter, called the Beaver River: from thence they proceeded West by
the Slave Lake just described, on their war excursions, which they often
repeated, even till the Beaver Indians had procured arms, which was in
the year 1782.  If it so happened that they missed them, they proceeded
Westward till they were certain of wreaking their vengeance on those of
the Rocky Mountain, who being without arms, became an easy prey to their
blind and savage fury.  All the European articles they possessed,
previous to the year 1780, were obtained from the Knisteneaux and
Chepewyans, who brought them from Fort Churchill, and for which they
were made to pay an extravagant price.</p>

<p>As late as the year 1786, when the first traders from Canada arrived on
the banks of this river, the natives employed bows and snares, but at
present very little use is made of the former, and the latter are no
longer known.  They still entertain a great dread of their natural
enemies, but they are since become so well armed, that the others now
call them their allies.  The men are in general of a comely appearance,
and fond of personal decoration.  The women are of a contrary
disposition, and the slaves of the men: in common with all the Indian
tribes polygamy is allowed among them.  They are very subject to
jealousy, and fatal consequences frequently result from the indulgence
of that passion.  But notwithstanding the vigilance and severity which
is exercised by the husband, it seldom happens that a woman is without
her favourite, who, in the absence of the husband, exacts the same
submission, and practises the same tyranny.  And so premature is the
tender passion, that it is sometimes known to invigorate so early a
period of life as the age of eleven or twelve years.  The women are not
very prolific: a circumstance which may be attributed in a great
measure, to the hardships that they suffer for except a few small dogs,
they alone perform that labour which is allotted to beasts of burthen in
other countries.  It is not uncommon, while the men carry nothing but a
gun, that their wives and daughters follow with such weighty burdens,
that if they lay them down they cannot replace them, and that is a
kindness which the men will not deign to perform; so that during their
journeys they are frequently obliged to lean against a tree for a small
portion of temporary relief.  When they arrive at the place which their
tyrants have chosen for their encampment, they arrange the whole in a
few minutes, by forming a curve of poles, meeting at the top, and
expanding into circles of twelve or fifteen feet diameter at the bottom,
covered with dressed skins of the moose sewed together.  During these
preparations, the men sit down quietly to the enjoyment of their pipes,
if they happen to have any tobacco.  But notwithstanding this abject
state of slavery and submission, the women have a considerable influence
on the opinion of the men in every thing except their own domestic
situation.</p>

<p>These Indians are excellent hunters, and their exercise in that capacity
is so violent as to reduce them in general to a very meagre appearance.
Their religion is of a very contracted nature, and I never witnessed any
ceremony of devotion which they had not borrowed from the Knisteneaux,
their feasts and fasts being in imitation of that people.  They are more
vicious and warlike than the Chepewyans, from whence they sprang, though
they do not possess their selfishness, for while they have the means of
purchasing their necessaries, they are liberal and generous, but when
those are exhausted they become errant beggars: they are, however,
remarkable for their honesty, for in the whole tribe there were only two
women and a man who had been known to have swerved from that virtue, and
they were considered as objects of disregard and reprobation.  They are
afflicted with but few diseases, and their only remedies consist in
binding the temples, procuring perspiration, singing, and blowing on the
sick person, or affected part.  When death overtakes any of them, their
property, as I have before observed, is sacrificed and destroyed; nor is
there any failure of lamentation or mourning on such occasion: they who
are more nearly related to the departed person, black their faces, and
sometimes cut off their hair; they also pierce their arms with knives
and arrows.  The grief of the females is carried to a still greater
excess; they not only cut their hair, and cry and howl, but they will
sometimes, with the utmost deliberation, employ some sharp instrument to
separate the nail from the finger, and then force back the flesh beyond
the first joint, which they immediately amputate.  But this
extraordinary mark of affliction is only displayed on the death of a
favourite son, a husband, or a father.  Many of the old women have so
often repeated this ceremony, that they have not a complete finger
remaining on either hand.  The women renew their lamentations at the
graves of their departed relatives, for a long succession of years.
They appear, in common with all the Indian tribes, to be very fond of
their children, but they are as careless in their mode of swadling them
in their infant state, as they are of their own dress: the child is laid
down on aboard, of about two feet long, covered with a bed of moss, to
which it is fastened by bandages, the moss being changed as often as the
occasion requires.  The chief of the nation had no less than nine wives,
and children in proportion.</p>

<p>When traders first appeared among these people, the Canadians were
treated with the utmost hospitality and attention; but they have, by
their subsequent conduct, taught the natives to withdraw that respect
from them, and sometimes to treat them with indignity.  They differ very
much from the Chepewyans and Knisteneaux, in the abhorrence they profess
of any carnal communication between their women and the white people.
They carry their love of gaming to excess; they will pursue it for a
succession of days and nights, and no apprehension of ruin, nor
influence of domestic affection, will restrain them from the indulgence
of it.  They are a quick, lively, active people, with a keen,
penetrating, dark eye; and though they are very susceptible of anger,
are as easily appeased.  The males eradicate their beards, and the
females their hair in every part, except their heads, where it is strong
and black, and without a curl.  There are many old men among them, but
they are in general ignorant of the space in which they have been
inhabitants of the earth, though one of them told me that he recollected
sixty winters.</p>

<p>An Indian in some measure explained his age to me, by relating that he
remembered the opposite hills and plains, now interspersed with groves
of poplars, when they were covered with moss, and without any animal
inhabitant but the rein-deer.  By degrees, he said, the face of the
country changed to its present appearance, when the elk came from the
East, and was followed by the buffalo; the rein-deer then retired to the
long range of high lands that, at a considerable distance, run parallel,
with this river.</p>

<p>On the 20th of April I had an observation of Jupiter and his satellites,
for the longitude, and we were now visited by our summer companions the
gnats and musquitoes.  On the other side of the river, which was yet
covered with ice, the plains were delightful; the trees were budding,
and many plants in blossom.  Mr. Mackay brought me a bunch of flowers of
a pink colour, and a yellow button, encircled with six leaves of a light
purple.  The change in the appearance of nature was as sudden as it was
pleasing, for a few days only were passed away since the ground was
covered with snow.  On the 25th the river was cleared of the ice.</p>

<p>I new found that the death of the man called the White Partridge, had
deranged all the plans which I had settled with the Indians for the
spring hunting.  They had assembled at some distance from the fort, and
sent an embassy to me, to demand rum to drink, that they might have an
opportunity of crying for their deceased brother.  It would be
considered as an extreme degradation in an Indian to weep when sober,
but a state of intoxication sanctions all irregularities.  On my
refusal, they threatened to go to war, which, from motives of interest
as well as humanity, we did our utmost to discourage; and as a second
message was brought by persons of some weight among these people, and on
whom I could depend, I thought it prudent to comply with the demand, on
an express condition, that they would continue peaceably at home.</p>

<p>The month of April being now past, in the early part of which I was most
busily employed in trading with the Indians, I ordered our old canoes to
be repaired with bark, and added four new ones to them, when, with the
furs and provisions I had purchased, six canoes were loaded and
dispatched on the 8th of May, for Fort Chepewyan.  I had, however,
retained six of the men, who agreed to accompany me on my projected
voyage of discovery.  I also engaged my hunters, and closed the business
of the year for the company by writing my public and private dispatches.</p>

<p>Having ascertained, by various observations, the latitude of this place
to be 56. 9. North, and longitude 117. 35. 15. West: on the 9th day of
May, I found, that my achrometer was one hour forty-six minutes slow to
apparent time; the mean going of it I had found to be twenty-two seconds
slow in twenty-four hours.  Having settled this point, the canoe was put
into the water; her dimensions were twenty-five feet long within,
exclusive of the curves of stem and stern, twenty-six inches hold, and
four feet nine inches beam.  At the same time she was so light, that two
men could carry her on a good road three or four miles without resting.
In this slender vessel, we shipped provisions, goods for presents, arms,
ammunition, and baggage, to the weight of three thousand pounds, and an
equipage of ten people; viz. Alexander Mackay, Joseph Landry, Charles
Ducette,<a name="v2-c1-hl2" href="#v2-c1-hr2">[2]</a> Francois Beaulieux, Baptist Bisson, Francois Courtois, and
Jaques Beauchamp, with two Indians, as hunters and interpreters.  One of
them, when a boy, used to be so idle, that he obtained the reputable
name of Cancre, which he still possesses.  With these persons I embarked
at seven in the evening.  My winter interpreter, with another person,
whom I left here to take care of the fort, and supply the natives with
ammunition during the summer, shed tears on the reflection of those
dangers which we might encounter in our expedition, while my own people
offered up their prayers that we might return in safety from it.</p>


<p class="footnote"><a name="v2-c1-hr1" href="#v2-c1-hl1">[1]</a> When they are drinking together, they frequently present their guns
to each other, when any of the parties have not other means of procuring
rum.  On such an occasion they always discharge their pieces, as a
proof, I imagine, of their being in good order, and to determine the
quantity of liquor they may propose to get in exchange for them.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="v2-c1-hr2" href="#v2-c1-hl2">[2]</a>Joseph Landry and Charles Ducette were with me in my former voyage.</p>

<h4><a name="chapter2" href="#toc_chapter2"> CHAPTER II.</a></h4>

<p class="noindent">MAY, 1793.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Thursday, 9.</i>&mdash;We began our voyage with a course South by West
against a strong current one mile and three quarters, South-West by
South one mile, and landed before eight on an island for the night.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friday, 10.</i>&mdash;The weather was clear and pleasant, though there was a
keenness in the air; and at a quarter past three in the morning we
continued our voyage, steering South-West three quarters of a mile,
South-West by South one mile and a quarter, South three quarters of a
mile, South-West by South one quarter of a mile, South-West by West one
mile, South-West by South three miles, South by West three quarters of a
mile, and South-West one mile.  The canoe being strained from its having
been very heavily laden, became so leaky, that we were obliged to land,
unload, and gum it.  As this circumstance took place about twelve, I had
an opportunity of taking an altitude, which made our latitude
55. 58. 48.</p>

<p>When the canoe was repaired we continued our course, steering South-West
by West one mile and an half, when I had the misfortune to drop my
pocket-compass into the water; West half a mile, West-South-West four
miles and an half.  Here, the banks are steep and hilly, and in some
parts undermined by the river.  Where the earth has given way, the face
of the cliffs discovers numerous strata, consisting of reddish earth and
small stones, bitumen, and a greyish earth, below which, near the
water-edge, is a red stone.  Water issues from most of the banks, and
the ground on which it spreads is covered with a thin white scurf, or
particles of a saline substance: there are several of these salt
springs.  At half past six in the afternoon the young men landed, when
they killed an elk and wounded a buffalo.  In this spot we formed our
encampment for the night.</p>

<p>From the place which we quitted this morning, the West side of the river
displayed a succession of the most beautiful scenery I had ever beheld.
The ground rises at intervals to a considerable height, and stretching
inwards to a considerable distance: at every interval or pause in the
rise, there is a very gently-ascending space or lawn, which is alternate
with abrupt precipices to the summit of the whole, or, at least as far
as the eye could distinguish.  This magnificent theatre of nature has
all the decorations which the trees and animals of the country can
afford it: groves of poplars in every shape vary the scene; and their
intervals are enlivened with vast herds of elks and buffaloes: the
former choosing the steeps and uplands, and the latter preferring the
plains.  At this time the buffaloes were attended with their young ones
who were frisking about them: and it appeared that the elks would soon
exhibit the same enlivening circumstance.  The whole country displayed
an exuberant verdure; the trees that bear a blossom were advancing fast
to that delightful appearance, and the velvet rind of their branches
reflecting the oblique rays of a rising or setting sun, added a splendid
gaiety to the scene, which no expressions of mine are qualified to
describe.  The East side of the river consists of a range of high land
covered with the white spruce and the soft birch, while the banks abound
with the alder and the willow.  The water continued to rise, and the
current being proportionately strong, we made a greater use of setting
poles than paddles.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Saturday, 11.</i>&mdash;The weather was overcast.  With a strong wind a-head,
we embarked at four in the morning, and left all the fresh meat behind
us, but the portion which had been assigned to the kettle; the canoe
being already too heavily laden.  Our course was West-South-West one
mile, where a small river flowed in from the East, named <i>Quiscatina
Sepy</i>, or River with the High Banks; West half a mile, South half a
mile, South-West by West three quarters of a mile, West one mile and a
quarter, South-West a quarter of a mile, South-South-West half a mile,
and West by South a mile and a half.  Here I took a meridian altitude,
which gave 55. 56.  3. North latitude.  We then proceeded West three
miles and a half, West-South-West, where the whole plain was on fire,
one mile, West one mile, and the wind so strong a-head, that it
occasioned the canoe to take in water, and otherwise impeded our
progress.  Here we landed to take time, with the mean of three
altitudes, which made the watch slow 1. 42. 10.</p>

<p>We now proceeded West-South-West one mile and a quarter, where we found
a chief of the Beaver Indians on a hunting party.  I remained, however,
in my canoe, and though it was getting late, I did not choose to encamp
with these people, lest the friends of my hunters might discourage them
from proceeding on the voyage.  We, therefore, continued our course, but
several Indians kept company with us, running along the bank, and
conversing with my people, who were so attentive to them, that they
drove the canoe on a stony flat, so that we were under the necessity of
landing to repair the damages, and put up for the night, though very
contrary to my wishes.  My hunters obtained permission to proceed with
some of these people to their lodges, on the promise of being back by
the break of day; though I was not without some apprehension respecting
them.  The chief, however, and another man, as well as several people
from the lodges, joined us, before we had completed the repair of the
canoe; and they made out a melancholy story, that they had neither
ammunition or tobacco sufficient for their necessary supply during the
summer.  I accordingly referred him to the Fort, where plenty of those
articles were left in the care of my interpreter, by whom they would be
abundantly furnished, if they were active and industrious in pursuing
their occupations.  I did not fail, on this occasion, to magnify the
advantages of the present expedition; observing, at the same time, that
its success would depend on the fidelity and conduct of the young men
who were retained by me to hunt.  The chief also proposed to borrow my
canoe, in order to transport himself and family across the river;
several plausible reasons, it is true, suggested themselves for
resisting his proposition; but when I stated to him, that, as the canoe
was intended for a voyage of such consequence, no woman could be
permitted to be embarked in it, he acquiesced in the refusal.  It was
near twelve at night when he took his leave, after I had gratified him
with a present of tobacco.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sunday, 12.</i>&mdash;Some of the Indians passed the night with us, and I was
informed by them, that according to our mode of proceeding, we should,
in ten days, get as far as the rocky mountains.  The young men now
returned, to my great satisfaction, and with the appearance of
contentment; though I was not pleased when they dressed themselves in
the clothes which I had given them before we left the Fort, as it
betrayed some latent design.</p>

<p>At four in the morning we proceeded on our voyage, steering West three
miles, including one of our course yesterday, North-West by North four
miles, West two miles and a half, North-West by West a mile and a half,
North by East two miles, North-West by West one mile, and
North-North-West three miles.  After a continuation of our course to the
North for a mile and a half, we landed for the night on an island where
several of the Indians visited us, but unattended by their women, who
remained in their camp, which was at some distance from us.</p>

<p>The land on both sides of the river, during the two last days, is very
much elevated, but particularly in the latter part of it, and, on the
Western side, presents in different places, white, steep, and lofty
cliffs.  Our view being confined by these circumstances, we did not see
so many animals as on the 10th.  Between these lofty boundaries, the
river becomes narrow and in a great measure free from islands; for we
had passed only four: the stream, indeed, was not more than from two
hundred to three hundred yards broad; whereas before these cliffs
pressed upon it, its breadth was twice that extent and besprinkled with
islands.  We killed an elk, and fired several shots at animals from the
canoe.</p>

<p>The greater part of this band being Rocky Mountain Indians, I
endeavoured to obtain some intelligence of our intended route, but they
all pleaded ignorance, and uniformly declared, that they knew nothing of
the country beyond the first mountain: at the same time they were of
opinion, that, from the strength of the current and the rapids we should
not get there by water; though they did not hesitate to express their
surprise at the expedition we had already made.</p>

<p>I inquired, with some anxiety, after an old man who had already given
me an account of the country beyond the limits of his tribe, and was very
much disappointed at being informed, that he had not been seen for upwards
of a moon. This man had been at war on another large river beyond the Rocky
Mountain, and described to me a fork of it between the mountains; the
Southern branch of which he directed me to take; from thence, he said,
there was a carrying-place of about a day's march for a young man to get
to the river.  To prove the truth of his relation, he consented, that
his son, who had been with him in those parts, should accompany me; and
he accordingly sent him to the fort some days before my departure; but
the preceding night he deserted with another young man, whose
application to attend me as a hunter, being refused, he persuaded the
other to leave me.  I now thought it right to repeat to them what I had
said to the chief of the first band, respecting the advantages which
would be derived from the voyage, that the young men might be encouraged
to remain with me; as without them I should not have attempted to
proceed.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Monday, 13.</i>&mdash;The first object that presented itself to me this
morning was the young man whom I have already mentioned, as having
seduced away my intended guide.  At any other time or place, I should
have chastised him for his past conduct, but in my situation it was
necessary to pass over his offence, lest he should endeavour to exercise
the same influence over those who were so essential to my service.  Of
the deserted he gave no satisfactory account, but continued to express
his wish to attend me in his place, for which he did not possess any
necessary qualifications.</p>

<p>The weather was cloudy, with an appearance of rain; and the Indians
pressed me with great earnestness to pass the day with them, and hoped
to prolong my stay among them by assuring me that the winter yet
lingered in the rocky mountains; but my object was to lose no time, and
having given the chief some tobacco for a small quantity of meat, we
embarked at four, when my young men could not conceal their chagrin at
parting with their friends, for so long a period as the voyage
threatened to occupy.  When I had assured them that in three moons we
should return to them, we proceeded on our course West-North-West half a
mile, West-South-West one mile and a half, West by North three miles,
North-West by West two miles and a half, South-West by West half a mile,
South-South-West a mile and a half, and South-West a mile and a half.
Here I had a meridian altitude, which gave 56. 17. 44. North latitude.</p>

<p>The last course continued a mile and a half, South by West, three
quarters of a mile, South-West by South three miles and a half, and
West-South-West two miles and a half.  Here the land lowered on both
sides, with an increase of wood, and displayed great numbers of animals.
The river also widened from three to five hundred yards, and was full of
islands and flats.  Having continued our course three miles, we made for
the shore at seven, to pass the night.</p>

<p>At the place from whence we proceeded this morning, a river falls in
from the North; there are also several islands, and many rivulets on
either side, which are too small to deserve particular notice.  We
perceived along the river, tracks of large bears, some of which were
nine inches wide, and of a proportionate length.  We saw one of their
dens, or winter-quarters, called <i>watee</i>, in an island, which was ten
feet deep, five feet high, and six feet wide; but we had not yet seen
one of those animals.  The Indians entertain great apprehension of this
kind of bear, which is called the grisly bear, and they never venture to
attack it but in a party of at least three or four.  Our hunters, though
they had been much higher than this part of our voyage, by land, knew
nothing of the river.  One of them mentioned, that having been engaged
in a war expedition, his party on their return made their canoes at some
distance below us.  The wind was North throughout the day, and at times
blew with considerable violence.</p>

<p>The apprehensions which I had felt respecting the young men were not
altogether groundless, for the eldest of them told me that his uncle had
last night addressed him in the following manner:&mdash;"My nephew, your
departure makes my heart painful.  The white people may be said to rob
us of you.  They are about to conduct you into the midst of our enemies,
and you may nevermore return to us.  Were you not with the Chief,<a name="v2-c2-hl1" href="#v2-c2-hr1">[1]</a> I
know not what I should do, but he requires your attendance, and you must
follow him."</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Tuesday, 14.</i>&mdash;The weather was clear, and the air sharp, when we
embarked at half past four.  Our course was South by West one mile and a
half, South-West by South half a mile, South-West.</p>

<p>We here found it necessary to unload, and gum the canoe, in which
operation we lost an hour; when we proceeded on the last course one mile
and a half.  I now took a meridian altitude, which gave 56. 1. 19. North
latitude, and continued to proceed West-South-West two miles and a half.
Here the Bear River which is of a large appearance, falls in from the
East; West three miles and an half, South-South-West one mile and an
half, and South-West four miles and an half, when we encamped upon an
island about seven in the evening.</p>

<p>During the early part of the day, the current was not so strong as we
had generally found it, but towards the evening it became very rapid,
and was broken by numerous islands.  We were gratified as usual, with
the sight of animals.  The land on the West side is very irregular, but
has the appearance of being a good beaver country; indeed we saw some of
those animals in the river.  Wood is in great plenty, and several
rivulets added their streams to the main river.  A goose was the only
article of provision which we procured to-day.  Smoke was seen, but at a
great distance before us.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Wednesday, 15.</i>&mdash;The rain prevented us from continuing our route till
past six in the morning, when our course was South-West by West three
quarters of a mile; at which time we passed a river on the left, West by
South two miles and a half.  The bank was steep, and the current strong.
The last course continued one mile and a half, West-South-West two
miles, where a river flowed in from the right, West by South one mile
and a half, West-North-West one mile, and West by North two miles.  Here
the land takes the form of an high ridge, and cut our course, which was
West for three miles, at right angles.  We now completed the voyage of
this day.</p>

<p>In the preceding night the water rose upwards of two inches, and had
risen in this proportion since our departure.  The wind, which was
West-South-West, blew very hard throughout the day, and with the
strength of the current, greatly impeded our progress.  The river, in
this part of it, is full of islands; and the land, on the South or left
side, is thick with wood.  Several rivulets also fall in from that
quarter.  At the entrance of the last river which we passed, there was a
quantity of wood, which had been cut down by axes, and some by the
beaver.  This fall, however, was not made, in the opinion of my people,
by any of the Indians with whom we were acquainted.</p>

<p>The land to the right is of a very irregular elevation and appearance,
composed in some places of clay, and rocky cliffs, and others exhibiting
stratas of red, green, and yellow colours.  Some parts, indeed, offer a
beautiful scenery, in some degree similar to that which we passed on the
second day of our voyage, and equally enlivened with the elk and the
buffalo, who were feeding in great numbers, and unmolested by the
hunter.  In an island which we passed, there was a large quantity of
white birch, whose bark might be employed in the construction of canoes.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Thursday, 16.</i>&mdash;The weather being clear, we re-embarked at four in
the morning, and proceeded West by North three miles.  Here the land
again appeared as if it run across our course, and a considerable river
discharged itself by various streams.  According to the Rocky Mountain
Indian, it is called the Sinew River.  This spot would be an excellent
situation for a fort or factory, as there is plenty of wood, and every
reason to believe that the country abounds in beaver.  As for the other
animals, they are in evident abundance, as in every direction the elk
and the buffalo are seen in possession of the hills and the plains.  Our
course continued West-North-West three miles and a half, North-West one
mile and a half, South-West by West two miles; (the latitude was by
observation 56. 16. 54.)  North, West by North half a mile,
West-North-West three quarters of a mile; a small river appearing on the
right, North-West one mile and a half, West by North half a mile, West
by South one mile and a half, West one mile; and at seven we formed our
encampment.</p>

<p>Mr. Mackay, and one of the young men, killed two elks, and mortally
wounded a buffalo, but we only took a part of the flesh of the former.
The land above the spot where we encamped, spreads into an extensive
plain, and stretches on to a very high ridge, which, in some parts,
presents a face of rock, but is principally covered with verdure, and
varied with the poplar and white birch tree.  The country is so crowded
with animals as to have the appearance, in some places, of a stall-yard,
from the state of the ground, and the quantity of dung which is
scattered over it.  The soil is black and light.  We this day saw two
grisly and hideous bears.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friday, 17.</i>&mdash;It froze during the night, and the air was sharp in the
morning, when we continued our course West-North-West three miles and a
half, South-West by South two miles and a half, South-West by West one
mile and a half, West three quarters of a mile, West-South-West one mile
and a quarter, and South-West by South one mile and a half.  At two in
the afternoon the rocky mountains appeared in sight, with their summits
covered with snow, bearing South-West by South: they formed a very
agreeable object to every person in the canoe, as we attained the view
of them much sooner than we expected.  A small river was seen on our
right, and we continued our progress South-West by South six miles, when
we landed at seven, which was our usual hour of encampment.</p>

<p>Mr. Mackay, who was walking along the side of the river, discharged his
piece at a buffalo, when it burst near the muzzle, but without any
mischievous consequences.  On the high grounds, which were on the
opposite side of the river, we saw a buffalo tearing up and down with
great fury, but could not discern the cause of his impetuous motions; my
hunters conjectured that he had been wounded with on arrow by some of
the natives.  We ascended several rapids in the course of the day, and
saw one bear.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Saturday, 18.</i>&mdash;It again froze very hard during the night, and at
four in the morning we continued our voyage, but we had not proceeded
two hundred yards, before an accident happened to the canoe, which did
not, however, employ more than three quarters of an hour to complete the
repair.  We then steered South by West one mile and three quarters,
South-West by South three miles, South-West by West one mile and a
quarter, West by South three quarters of a mile, South-West half a mile,
West by South one mile, South by West one mile and a half,
South-South-West, where there is a small run of water from the right,
three miles and a half, when the canoe struck on the stump of a tree,
and unfortunately where the banks were so steep that there was no place
to unload, except a small spot, on which we contrived to dispose the
lading in the bow, which lightened the canoe so as to raise the broken
part of it above the surface of the water; by which contrivance we
reached a convenient situation.  It required, however, two hours to
complete the repair, when the weather became dark and cloudy, with
thunder, lightning, and rain; we, however, continued the last course
half a mile, and at six in the evening we were compelled by the rain to
land for the night.</p>

<p>About noon we had landed on an island where there were eight lodges of
last year.  The natives had prepared bark here for five canoes, and there is a road
along the hills where they had passed.  Branches were out and broken
along it; and they had also stripped off the bark of the trees, to get
the interior rind, which forms part of their food.</p>

<p>The current was very strong through the whole of the day, and the coming
up along some of the banks was rendered very dangerous, from the
continual falling of large stones, from the upper parts of them.  This
place appears to be a particular pass for animals across the river, as
there are paths leading to it on both sides, every ten yards.</p>

<p>In the course of the day we saw a ground hog, and two cormorants.  The
earth also appeared in several places to have been turned up by the
bears, in search of roots.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sunday, 19.</i>&mdash;It rained very hard in the early part of the night, but
the weather became clear towards the morning, when we embarked at our
usual hour.  As the current threatened to be very strong, Mr. Mackay,
the two hunters, and myself, went on shore, in order to lighten the
canoe, and ascended the hills, which are covered with cypress, and but
little encumbered with underwood.  We found a beaten path, and before we
had walked a mile, fell in with a herd of buffaloes, with their young
ones: but I would not suffer the Indians to fire on them, from an
apprehension that the report of their fowling pieces would alarm the
natives that might be in the neighbourhood; for we were at this time so
near the mountains, as to justify our expectation of seeing some of
them.  We, however, sent our dog after the herd, and a calf was soon
secured by him.  While the young men were skinning the animal, we heard
two reports of fire arms from the canoe, which we answered, as it was a
signal for my return; we then heard another, and immediately hastened
down the hill, with our veal, through a very close wood.  There we met
one of the men, who informed us that the canoe was at a small distance
below, at the foot of a very strong rapid, and that as several
waterfalls appeared up the river, we should be obliged to unload and
carry.  I accordingly hastened to the canoe, and was greatly displeased
that so much time had been lost, as I had given previous directions that
the river should be followed as long as it was practicable.  The last
Indians whom we saw had informed us that at the first mountain there was
a considerable succession of rapids, cascades, and falls, which they
never attempted to ascend; and where they always passed over land the
length of a day's march.  My men imagined that the carrying place was at
a small distance below us, as a path appeared to ascend a hill, where
there were several lodges, of the last year's construction.  The account
which had been given me of the rapids, was perfectly correct: though by
crossing to the other side, I must acknowledge with some risk, in such a
heavy laden canoe, the river appeared to me to be practicable, as far as
we could see: the traverse, therefore, was attempted, and proved
successful.  We now towed the canoe along an island, and proceeded
without any considerable difficulty, till we reached the extremity of
it, when the line could be no longer employed; and in endeavouring to
clear the point of the island, the canoe was driven with such violence
on a stony shore, as to receive considerable injury.  We now employed
every exertion in our power to repair the breach that had been made, as
well as to dry such articles of our loading as more immediately required
it: we then transported the whole across the point, when we reloaded,
and continued our course about three quarters of a mile.  We could now
proceed no further on this side of the water, and the traverse was
rendered extremely dangerous, not only from the strength of the current,
but by the cascades just below us, which, if we had got among them,
would have involved us and the canoe in one common destruction.  We had
no other alternative than to return by the same course we came, or to
hazard the traverse, the river on this side being bounded by a range of
steep, over-hanging rocks, beneath which the current was driven on with
resistless impetuosity from the cascades.  Here are several islands of
solid rock, covered with a small portion of verdure, which have been
worn away by the constant force of the current, and occasionally, as I
presume, of ice, at the water's edge, so as to be reduced in that part
to one fourth the extent of the upper surface; presenting, as it were,
so many large tables, each of which was supported by a pedestal of a
more circumscribed projection.  They are very elevated for such a
situation, and afford an asylum for geese, which were at this time
breeding on them.  By crossing from one to the other of these islands,
we came at length to the main traverse, on which we ventured, and were
successful in our passage.  Mr. Mackay, and the Indians, who observed
our manoeuvres from the top of a rock, were in continual alarm for our
safety, with which their own, indeed, may be said to have been nearly
connected: however, the dangers that we encountered were very much
augmented by the heavy loading of the canoe.</p>

<p>When we had effected our passage, the current on the West side was
almost equally violent with that from whence we had just escaped, but
the craggy bank being somewhat lower, we were enabled, with a line of
sixty fathoms, to tow the canoe, till we came to the foot of the most
rapid cascade we had hitherto seen.  Here we unloaded, and carried every
thing over a rocky point of an hundred and twenty paces.  When the canoe
was reloaded, I, with those of my people who were not immediately
employed, ascended the bank, which was there, and indeed, as far as we
could see, composed of clay, stone, and a yellow gravel.  My present
situation was so elevated, that the men, who were coming up a strong
point, could not hear me, though I called to them with the utmost
strength of my voice, to lighten the canoe of part of its lading.  And
here I could not but reflect, with infinite anxiety, on the hazard of my
enterprize; one false step of those who were attached to the line, or
the breaking of the line itself, would have at once consigned the canoe,
and every thing it contained, to instant destruction: it, however,
ascended the rapid in perfect security, but new dangers immediately
presented themselves, for stones, both small and great, were continually
rolling from the bank, so as to render the situation of those who were
dragging the canoe beneath it extremely perilous; besides, they were at
every step in danger, from the steepness of the ground, of falling into
the water: nor was my solicitude diminished by my being necessarily
removed at times from the sight of them.</p>

<p>In our passage through the woods, we came to an inclosure, which had
been formed by the natives for the purpose of setting snares for the
elk, and of which we could not discover the extent.  After we had
travelled for some hours through the forest, which consisted of the
spruce, birch, and the largest poplars I had ever seen, we sunk down
upon the river where the bank is low, and near the foot of a mountain;
between which, and a high ridge, the river flows in a channel of about
one hundred yards broad; though, at a small distance below, it rushes on
between perpendicular rocks, where it is not much more than half that
breadth.  Here I remained, in great anxiety, expecting the arrival of
the canoe, and after some time I sent Mr. Mackay with one of the Indians
down the river in search of it, and with the other I went up to it to
examine what we might expect in that quarter.  In about a mile and a
half I came to a part where the river washes the feet of lofty
precipices, and presented, in the form of rapids and cascades, a
succession of difficulties to our navigation.  As the canoe did not come
in sight, we returned, and from the place where I had separated with
Mr. Mackay, we saw the men carrying it over a small rocky point.  We met
them at the entrance of the narrow channel already mentioned; their
difficulties had been great indeed, and the canoe had been broken, but
they had persevered with success, and having passed the carrying-place,
we proceeded with the line as far as I had already been, when we crossed
over and encamped on the opposite beach; but there was no wood on this
side of the water, as the adjacent country had been entirely over-run by
fire.  We saw several elks feeding on the edge of the opposite
precipice, which was upwards of three hundred feet high.</p>

<p>Our course to-day was about South-South-West two miles and a half,
South-West half a mile, South-West by South one mile and a half, South
by West half a mile, South-West half a mile, and West one mile and a
half.  There was a shower of hail, and some rain from flying clouds.  I
now dispatched a man with an Indian to visit the rapids above, when the
latter soon left him to pursue a beaver, which was seen in the shallow
water on the inside of a stony island; and though Mr. Mackay, and the
other Indian joined him, the animal at length escaped from their
pursuit.  Several others were seen in the course of the day, which I by
no means expected, as the banks are almost every where so much elevated
above the channel of the river.  Just as the obscurity of the night drew
on, the man returned with an account that it would be impracticable to
pass several points, as well as the super-impending promontories.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Monday, 20.</i>&mdash;The weather was clear with a sharp air, and we renewed
our voyage at quarter past four, on a course South-West by West three
quarters of a mile.  We now, with infinite difficulty passed along the
foot of a rock, which, fortunately, was not an hard stone, so that we
were enabled to cut steps in it for the distance of twenty feet; from
which, at the hazard of my life, I leaped on a small rock below, where I
received those who followed me on my shoulders.  In this manner four of
us passed and dragged up the canoe, in which attempt we broke her.  Very
luckily, a dry tree had fallen from the rock above us, without which we
could not have made a fire, as no wood was to be procured within a mile
of the place.  When the canoe was repaired, we continued towing it along
the rocks to the next point, when we embarked, as we could not at
present make any further use of the line, but got along the rocks of a
round high island of stone, till we came to a small sandy bay.  As we
had already damaged the canoe, and had every reason to think that she
soon would risk much greater injury, it became necessary for us to
supply ourselves with bark, as our provision of that material article
was almost exhausted two men were accordingly sent to procure it, who
soon returned with the necessary store.</p>

<p>Mr. Mackay, and the Indians who had been on shore, since we broke the
canoe, were prevented from coming to us by the rugged and impassable
state of the ground.  We, therefore, again resumed our course with the
assistance of poles, with which we pushed onwards till we came beneath a
precipice, where we could not find any bottom; so that we were again
obliged to have recourse to the line, the management of which was
rendered not only difficult but dangerous, as the men employed in towing
were under the necessity of passing on the outside of trees that grew on
the edge of the precipice.  We, however, surmounted this difficulty, as
we had done many others, and the people who had been walking over land
now joined us.  They also had met with their obstacles in passing the
mountain.</p>

<p>It now became necessary for us to make a traverse, where the water was
so rapid, that some of the people stripped themselves to their shirts
that they might be the better prepared for swimming, in case any
accident happened to the canoe, which they seriously apprehended; but we
succeeded in our attempt without any other inconvenience, except that of
taking in water.  We now came to a cascade, when it was thought
necessary to take out part of the lading.  At noon we stopped to take an
altitude, opposite to a small river that flowed in from the left: while
I was thus engaged, the men went on shore to fasten the canoe, but as
the current was not very strong, they had been negligent in performing
this office; it proved, however, sufficiently powerful to sheer her off,
and if it had not happened that one of the men, from absolute fatigue
had remained and held the end of the line, we should have been deprived
of every means of prosecuting our voyage, as well as of present
subsistence.  But notwithstanding the state of my mind on such an
alarming circumstance, and an intervening cloud that interrupted me, the
altitude which I took has been since proved to be tolerably correct, and
gave 56. North latitude.  Our last course was South-South-West two miles
and a quarter.</p>

<p>We now continued our toilsome and perilous progress with the line West
by North, and as we proceeded the rapidity of the current increased, so
that in the distance of two miles we were obliged to unload four times,
and carry every thing but the canoe: indeed, in many places, it was with
the utmost difficulty that we could prevent her from being dashed to
pieces against the rocks by the violence of the eddies.  At five we had
proceeded to where the river was one continued rapid.</p>

<p>Here we again took every thing out of the canoe, in order to tow her up
with the line, though the rocks were so shelving as greatly to increase
the toil and hazard of that operation.  At length, however, the
agitation of the water was so great, that a wave striking on the bow of
the canoe broke the line, and filled us with inexpressible dismay, as it
appeared impossible that the vessel could escape from being dashed to
pieces, and those who were in her from perishing.  Another wave,
however, more propitious than the former, drove her out of the tumbling
water, so that the men were enabled to bring her ashore, and though she
had been carried over rocks by these swells which left them naked a
moment after, the canoe had received no material injury.  The men were,
however, in such a state from their late alarm, that it would not only
have been unavailing but imprudent to have proposed any further progress
at present, particularly as the river above us, as far as we could see,
was one white sheet of foaming water.</p>

<h4><a name="chapter3" href="#toc_chapter3"> CHAPTER III.</a></h4>

<p>MAY, 1793.</p>

<p>That the discouragements, difficulties, and dangers, which had hitherto
attended the progress of our enterprise, should have excited a wish in
several of those who were engaged in it to discontinue the pursuit,
might be naturally expected; and indeed it began to be muttered on all
sides that there was no alternative but to return.</p>

<p>Instead of paying any attention to these murmurs, I desired those who
had uttered them to exert themselves in gaining an ascent of the hill,
and encamp there for the night.  In the mean time I set off with one of
the Indians, and though I continued my examination of the river almost
as long as there was any light to assist me, I could see no end of the
rapids and cascades: I was, therefore, perfectly satisfied, that it
would be impracticable to proceed any further by water.  We returned
from this reconnoitring excursion very much fatigued, with our shoes
worn out and wounded feet; when I found that, by felling trees on the
declivity of the first hill, my people had contrived to ascend it.</p>

<p>From the place where I had taken the altitude at noon, to the place
where we made our landing, the river is not more than fifty yards wide,
and flows between stupendous rocks, from whence huge fragments sometimes
tumble down, and falling from such an height, dash into small stones,
with sharp points, and form the beach between the rocky projections.
Along the face of some of these precipices, there appears a stratum of a
bitumenous substance which resembles coal; though while some of the
pieces of it appeared to be excellent fuel, others resisted, for a
considerable time, the action of fire, and did not emit the least flame.
The whole of this day's course would have been altogether impracticable,
if the water had been higher, which must be the case at certain seasons.
We saw also several encampments of the Knisteneaux along the river,
which must have been formed by them on their war excursions: a decided
proof of the savage, blood-thirsty disposition of that people; as
nothing less than such a spirit could impel them to encounter the
difficulties of this almost inaccessible country, whose natives are
equally unoffending and defenceless.</p>

<p>Mr. Mackay informed me, that in passing over the mountains, he observed
several chasms in the earth that emitted heat and smoke, which diffused
a strong sulphureous stench.  I should certainly have visited this
phenomenon, if I had been sufficiently qualified as a naturalist, to
have offered scientific conjectures or observations thereon.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Tuesday, 21.</i>&mdash;It rained in the morning, and did not cease till about
eight, and as the men had been very fatigued and disheartened, I
suffered them to continue their rest till that hour.  Such was the state
of the river, as I have already observed, that no alternative was left
us; nor did any means of proceeding present themselves to us, but the
passage of the mountain over which we were to carry the canoe as well as
the baggage.  As this was a very alarming enterprize, I dispatched
Mr. Mackay with three men and the two Indians to proceed in a strait
course from the top of the mountain, and to keep the line of the river
till they should find it navigable.  If it should be their opinion, that
there was no practicable passage in that direction, two of them were
instructed to return in order to make their report; while the others
were to go in search of the Indian carrying-place.  While they were
engaged in this excursion, the people who remained with me were employed
in gumming the canoe, and making handles for the axes.  At noon I got an
altitude, which made our latitude 56. 0. 8.  At three o'clock had time,
when my watch was slow 1. 31. 32. apparent time.</p>

<p>At sun-set, Mr. Mackay returned with one of the men, and in about two
hours was followed by the others.  They had penetrated thick woods,
ascended hills and sunk into vallies, till they got beyond the rapid,
which, according to their calculation, was a distance of three leagues.
The two parties returned by different routes, but they both agreed, that
with all its difficulties, and they were of a very alarming nature, the
outward course was that which must be preferred.  Unpromising, however,
as the account of their expedition appeared, it did not sink them into a
state of discouragement; and a kettle of wild rice, sweetened with
sugar, which had been prepared for their return, with their usual regale
of rum, soon renewed that courage which disdained all obstacles that
threatened our progress: and they went to rest, with a full
determination to surmount them on the morrow.  I sat up, in the hope of
getting an observation of Jupiter and his first satellite, but the
cloudy weather prevented my obtaining it.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Wednesday, 22.</i>&mdash;At break of day we entered on the extraordinary
journey which was to occupy the remaining part of it.  The men began,
without delay, to cut a road up the mountain, and as the trees were but
of small growth, I ordered them to fell those which they found
convenient, in such a manner, that they might fall parallel with the
road, but, at the same time not separate them entirely from the stumps,
so that they might form a kind of railing on either side.  The baggage
was now brought from the water side to our encampment.  This was,
likewise, from the steep shelving of the rocks, a very perilous
undertaking, as one false step of any of the people employed in it,
would have been instantly followed by falling headlong into the water.
When this important object was attained, the whole of the party
proceeded with no small degree of apprehension, to fetch the canoe,
which, in a short time, was also brought to the encampment; and, as soon
as we had recovered from our fatigue, we advanced with it up the
mountain, having the line doubled and fastened successively as we went
on to the stumps; while a man at the end of it, hauled it around a tree,
holding it on and shifting it as we proceeded; so that we may be said,
with strict truth, to have warped the canoe up the mountain; indeed by a
general and most laborious exertion, we got every thing to the summit by
two in the afternoon.  At noon, the latitude was 56. 0. 47. North.  At
five, I sent the men to cut the road onwards, which they effected for
about a mile, when they returned:</p>

<p>The weather was cloudy at intervals, with showers and thunder.  At about
ten, I observed an emersion of Jupiter's second satellite; time by the
achrometer 8. 32. 20. by which I found the longitude to be 120. 29. 80
West from Greenwich.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Thursday 23.</i>&mdash;The weather was clear at four this morning, when the
men began to carry.  I joined Mr. Mackay and the two Indians in the
labour of cutting a road.  The ground continued rising gently till noon,
when it began to decline; but though on such an elevated situation, we
could see but little, as mountains of a still higher elevation, and
covered with snow, were seen far above us in every direction.  In the
afternoon the ground became very uneven; hills and deep defiles
alternately presented themselves to us.  Our progress, however, exceeded
my expectation, and it was not till four in the afternoon that the
carriers overtook us.  At five, in a state of fatigue that may be more
readily conceived than expressed, we encamped near a rivulet or spring
that issued from beneath a large mass of ice and snow.</p>

<p>Our toilsome journey of this day I compute at about three miles; along
the first of which the land is covered with plenty of wood, consisting
of large trees, encumbered with little underwood, through which it was
by no means difficult to open a road, by following a well-beaten elk
path: for the two succeeding miles we found the country overspread with
the trunks of trees, laid low by fire some years ago; among which large
copses had sprung up of a close growth, and intermixed with briars, so
as to render the passage through them painful and tedious.  The soil in
the woods is light and of a dusky colour; that in the burned country is
a mixture of sand and clay with small stones.  The trees are spruce,
red-pine, cypress, poplar, white birch, willow, alder, arrow-wood,
red-wood, liard, service-tree, bois-picant, &amp;c.  I never saw any of the
last kind before.  It rises to about nine feet in height, grows in
joints without branches, and is tufted at the extremity.  The stem is of
an equal size from the bottom to the top, and does not exceed an inch in
diameter; it is covered with small prickles, which caught our trowsers,
and working through them, sometimes found their way to the flesh.  The
shrubs are, the gooseberry, the currant, and several kinds of briars.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friday, 24.</i>&mdash;We continued our very laborious journey, which led us
down some steep hills, and through a wood of tall pines.  After much
toil and trouble in bearing the canoe through the difficult passages
which we encountered, at four in the afternoon we arrived at the river,
some hundred yards above the rapids or falls, with all our baggage.  I
compute the distance of this day's progress to be about four miles;
indeed I should have measured the whole of the way, if I had not been
obliged to engage personally in the labour of making the road.  But
after all, the Indian carrying-way, whatever may be its length, and I
think it cannot exceed ten miles, will always be found more safe and
expeditious than the passage which our toil and perseverance formed and
surmounted.</p>

<p>Those of my people who visited this place on the 21st, were of opinion
that the water had risen very much since that time.  About two hundred
yards below us, the stream rushed with an astonishing but silent
velocity, between perpendicular rocks, which are not more than
thirty-five yards asunder: when the water is high, it runs over those
rocks, in a channel three times that breadth, where it is bounded by far
more elevated precipices.  In the former are deep round holes, some of
which are full of water, while others are empty, in whose bottom are
small round stones, as smooth as marble.  Some of these natural
cylinders would contain two hundred gallons.  At a small distance below
the first of these rocks, the channel widens in a kind of zig-zag
progression; and it was really awful to behold with what infinite force
the water drives against the rocks on one side, and with what impetuous
strength it is repelled to the other: it then falls back, as it were,
into a more strait but rugged passage, over which it is tossed in high,
foaming, half-formed billows, as far as the eye could follow it.</p>

<p>The young men informed me that this was the place where their relations
had told me that I should meet with a fall equal to that of Niagara: to
exculpate them, however, from their apparent misinformation, they
declared that their friends were not accustomed to utter falsehoods, and
that the fall had probably been destroyed by the force of the water.  It
is, however, very evident that those people had not been here, or did
not adhere to the truth.  By the number of trees which appeared to have
been felled with axes, we discovered that the Knisteneaux, or some
tribes who are known to employ that instrument, had passed this way.  We
passed through a snare enclosure, but saw no animals, though the country
was very much intersected by their tracks.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Saturday, 25.</i>&mdash;It rained throughout the night, and till twelve this
day; while the business of preparing great and small poles, and putting
the canoe in order, &amp;c. caused us to remain here till five in the
afternoon.  I now attached a knife, with a steel, flint, beads, and
other trifling articles to a pole, which I erected, and left as a token
of amity to the natives.  When I was making this arrangement, one of my
attendants, whom I have already described under the title of the Cancre,
added to my assortment, a small round piece of green wood, chewed at one
end in the form of a brush, which the Indians used to pick the marrow
out of bones.  This he informed me was an emblem of a country abounding
in animals.  The water had risen during our stay here one foot and a
half perpendicular height.</p>

<p>We now embarked, and our course was North-West one mile and three
quarters.  There were mountains on all sides of us, which were covered
with snow; one in particular, on the South side of the river, rose to a
great height.  We continued to proceed West three quarters of a mile,
North-West one mile, and West-South-West a quarter of a mile, when we
encamped for the night.  The Cancre killed a small elk.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sunday, 26.</i>&mdash;The weather was clear and sharp, and between three and
four in the morning we renewed our voyage, our first course being West
by South three miles and a half, when the men complained of the cold in
their fingers, as they were obliged to push on the canoe with the poles.
Here a small river flowed in from the North.  We now continued to steer
West-South-West a quarter of a mile; West-North-West a mile and a half,
and West two miles, when we found ourselves on a parallel with a chain
of mountains on both sides of the river, running South and North.  The
river, both yesterday and the early part of to-day, was from four to
eight hundred yards wide, and full of islands, but was at this time
diminished to about two hundred yards broad, and free from islands, with
a smooth but strong current.  Our next course was South-West two miles,
when we encountered a rapid, and saw an encampment of the Knisteneaux.
We now proceeded North-West by West one mile, among islands, South-West
by West three quarters of a mile, South-South-East one mile, veered to
South-West through islands three miles and a half, and South by East
half a mile.  Here a river poured in on the left, which was the most
considerable that we had seen since we had passed the mountain.  At
seven in the evening we landed and encamped.</p>

<p>Though the sun had shone upon us throughout the day, the air was so cold
that the men, though actively employed, could not resist it without the
aid of their blanket coats.  This circumstance might, in some degree, be
expected from the surrounding mountains, which were covered with ice and
snow; but as they are not so high as to produce the extreme cold which
we suffered, it must be more particularly attributed to the high
situation of the country itself, rather than to the local elevation of
the mountains, the greatest height of which does not exceed fifteen
hundred feet; though in general they do not rise to half that altitude.</p>

<p>But as I had not been able to take an exact measurement, I do not
presume upon the accuracy of my conjecture.  Towards the bottom of these
heights, which were clear of snow, the trees were putting forth their
leaves, while those in their middle region still retained all the
characteristics of winter, and on the upper parts there was little or no
wood.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Monday, 27.</i>[<a name="v2-c3-hl1" href="#v2-c3-hr1">1]</a>&mdash;The weather was clear, and we continued our voyage
at the usual hour, when we successively found several rapids and points
to impede our progress.  At noon our latitude was 56. 5. 54. North.  The
Indians killed a stag; and one of the men who went to fetch it was very
much endangered by the rolling down of a large stone from the heights
above him.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Tuesday, 28.</i>&mdash;The day was very cloudy.  The mountains on both sides
of the river seemed to have sunk, in their elevation, during the voyage
of yesterday.  To-day they resumed their former altitude, and run so
close on either side of the channel, that all view was excluded of every
thing but themselves.  This part of the current was not broken by
islands; but in the afternoon we approached some cascades, which obliged
us to carry our canoe and its lading for several hundred yards.  Here we
observed an encampment of the natives, though some time had elapsed
since it had been inhabited.  The greater part of the day was divided
between heavy showers and small rain; and we took our station on the
shore about six in the evening, about three miles above the last rapid.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Wednesday, 29.</i>&mdash;The rain was so violent throughout the whole of this
day, that we did not venture to proceed.  As we had almost expended the
contents of a rum-keg, and this being a day which allowed of no active
employment, I amused myself with the experiment of enclosing a letter in
it, and dispatching it down the stream to take its fate.  I accordingly
introduced a written account of all our hardships, &amp;c.  carefully
enclosed in bark, into the small barrel by the bung-hole, which being
carefully secured, I consigned this epistolatory cargo to the mercy of
the current.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Thursday, 30.</i>&mdash;We were alarmed this morning at break of day, by the
continual barking of our dog, who never ceased from running backwards
and forwards in the rear of our situation: when, however, the day
advanced, we discovered the cause of our alarm to proceed from a wolf,
who was parading a ridge a few yards behind us, and had been most
probably allured by the scent of our small portion of fresh meat.  The
weather was cloudy, but it did not prevent us from renewing our progress
at a very early hour.  A considerable river appeared from the left, and
we continued our course till seven in the evening, when we landed at
night where there was an Indian encampment.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friday, 31.</i>&mdash;The morning was clear and cold, and the current very
powerful.  On crossing the mouth of a river that flowed in from the
right of us, we were very much endangered; indeed all the rivers which I
have lately seen, appear to overflow their natural limits, as it may be
supposed, from the melting of the mountain snow.  The water is almost
white, the bed of the river being of limestone.  The mountains are one
solid mass of the same material, but without the least shade of trees,
or decoration of foliage.  At nine the men were so cold that we landed,
in order to kindle a fire, which was considered as a very uncommon
circumstance at this season; a small quantity of rum, however, served as
an adequate substitute; and the current being so smooth as to admit of
the use of paddles, I encouraged them to proceed without any further
delay.  In a short time an extensive view opened upon us, displaying a
beautiful sheet of water, that was heightened by the calmness of the
weather, and a splendid sun.  Here the mountains which were covered with
wood, opened on either side, so that we entertained the hope of soon
leaving them behind us.  When we had got to the termination of this
prospect, the river was barred with rocks, forming cascades and small
islands.  To proceed onwards, we were under the necessity of clearing a
narrow passage of the drift wood, on the left shore.  Here the view
convinced us that our late hopes were without foundation, as there
appeared a ridge or chain of mountains, running South and North as far
as the eye could reach.</p>

<p>On advancing two or three miles, we arrived at the fork, one branch
running about West-North-West, and the other South-South-East.  If I had
been governed by my own judgment, I should have taken the former, as it
appeared to me to be the most likely to bring us nearest to the part
where I wished to fall on the Pacific Ocean, but the old man, whom I
have already mentioned as having been frequently on war expeditions in
this country, had warned me not, on any account, to follow it, as it was
soon lost in various branches among the mountains, and that there was no
great river that ran in any direction near it; but by following the
latter, he said, we should arrive at a carrying-place to another large
river, that did not exceed a day's march, where the inhabitants build
houses, and live upon islands.  There was so much apparent truth in the
old man's narrative, that I determined to be governed by it; for I did
not entertain the least doubt, if I could get into the other river, that
I should reach the ocean.</p>

<p>I accordingly ordered my steersman to proceed at once to the East
branch, which appeared to be more rapid than the other, though it did
not possess an equal breadth.  These circumstances disposed my men and
Indians, the latter in particular being very tired of the voyage, to
express their wishes that I should take the Western branch, especially
when they perceived the difficulty of stemming the current, in the
direction on which I had determined.  Indeed the rush of water was so
powerful, that we were the greatest part of the afternoon in getting two
or three miles&mdash;a very tardy and mortifying progress, and which, with
the voyage, was openly execrated by many of those who were engaged in
it: and the inexpressible toil these people had endured, as well as the
dangers they had encountered, required some degree of consideration; I
therefore employed those arguments which were the best calculated to
calm their immediate discontents, as well as to encourage their future
hopes, though, at the same time, I delivered my sentiments in such a
manner as to convince them that I was determined to proceed.</p>

<p>On the 1st of June we embarked at sun-rise, and towards noon the current
began to slacken; we then put to shore, in order to gum the canoe, when
a meridian altitude gave me 55. 42. 16. North latitude.  We then
continued our course, and towards the evening the current began to
recover its former strength.  Mr. Mackay and the Indians had already
disembarked, to walk and lighten the boat.  At sun-set we encamped on a
point, being the first dry land which had been found on this side the
river, that was fit for our purpose, since our people went on shore.  In
the morning we passed a large rapid river, that flowed in from the
right.</p>

<p>In no part of the North-West did I see so much beaver-work, within an
equal distance, as in the course of this day.  In some places they had
cut down several acres of large poplars; and we saw also a great number
of these active and sagacious animals.  The time which these wonderful
creatures allot for their labours, whether in erecting their curious
habitations or providing food, is the whole of the interval between the
setting and the rising sun.</p>

<p>Towards the dusky part of the evening we heard several discharges from
the fowling pieces of our people, which we answered, to inform them of
our situation; and some time after it was dark, they arrived in an equal
state of fatigue and alarm; they were also obliged to swim across a
channel in order to get to us, as we were situated on an island, though
we were ignorant of the circumstance, till they came to inform us.  One
of the Indians was positive that he heard the discharge of fire-arms
above our encampment; and on comparing the number of our discharges with
theirs, there appeared to be some foundation for his alarm, as we
imagined that we had heard two reports more than they acknowledged; and
in their turn, they declared that they had heard twice the number of
those which we knew had proceeded from us.  The Indians were therefore
certain, that the Knisteneaux must be in our vicinity, on a war
expedition, and consequently, if they were numerous, we should have had
no reason to expect the least mercy from them in this distant country.
Though I did not believe that circumstance, or that any of the natives
could be in possession of fire-arms, I thought it right, at all events,
we should be prepared.  Our fusees were, therefore, primed and loaded,
and having extinguished our fire, each of us took his station at the
foot of a tree, where we passed an uneasy and restless night.</p>

<p>The succeeding morning being clear and pleasant, we proceeded at an
early hour against a rapid current, intersected by islands.  About eight
we passed two large trees, whose roots having been undermined by the
current, had recently fallen into the river; and, in my opinion, the
crash of their fall had occasioned the noise which caused our late
alarm.  In this manner the water ravages the islands in these rivers,
and by driving down great quantities of wood, forms the foundations of
others.  The men were so oppressed with fatigue, that it was necessary
they should encamp at six in the afternoon.  We, therefore, landed on a
sandy island, which is a very uncommon object, as the greater part of
the islands consist of a bottom of round stones and gravel, covered from
three to ten feet with mud and old drift-wood.  Beaver-work was as
frequently seen as on the preceding day.</p>

<p>On the 3d of June we renewed our voyage with the rising sun.  At noon I
obtained a meridian altitude, which gave 55. 22. 3. North latitude.  I
also took time, and the watch was slow 1. 30. 14. apparent time.
According to my calculation, this place is about twenty-five miles
South-East of the fork.<a name="v2-c3-hl2" href="#v2-c3-hr2">[2]</a></p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="v2-c3-hr1" href="#v2-c3-hl1">[1]</a> From this day to the 4th of June the courses of my voyage are
omitted, as I lost the book that contained them.  I was in the habit of
sometimes indulging myself with a short doze in the canoe, and I imagine
that the branches of the trees brushed my book from me, when I was in
such a situation, which renders the account of these few days less
distinct than usual.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="v2-c3-hr2" href="#v2-c3-hl2">[2]</a> I shall now proceed with my usual regularity, which, as I have
already mentioned, has been, for some days, suspended, from the loss of
my book of observation.</p>

<br>

<h4><a name="chapter4" href="#toc_chapter4"> CHAPTER IV.</a></h4>

<p class="noindent">JUNE 4, 1793.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We embarked this morning at four in a very heavy fog.
The water had been continually rising, and, in many places, overflowed
its banks.  The current also was so strong that our progress was very
tedious, and required the most laborious exertions.  Our course was this
day, South-South-East one mile, South-South-West half a mile, South-East
three quarters of a mile, North-East by East three quarters of a mile,
South-East half a mile, South-East by South one mile, South-South-East
one mile and three quarters, South-East by South half a mile, East by
South a quarter of a mile, South-East three quarters of a mile,
North-East by East half a mile, East by North a quarter of a mile,
South-East half a mile, South-East by South a quarter of a mile,
South-East by East half a mile, North-East by East half a mile,
North-North-East three quarters of a mile to South by East one mile and
a half.  We could not find a place fit for an encampment, till nine at
night, when we landed on a bank of gravel, of which little more appeared
above water than the spot we occupied.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Wednesday, 5.</i>&mdash;This morning we found our canoe and baggage in the
water, which had continued rising during the night.  We then gummed the
canoe, as we arrived at too late an hour to perform that operation on
the preceding evening.  This necessary business being completed, we
traversed to the North shore, where I disembarked with Mr. Mackay, and
the hunters, in order to ascend an adjacent mountain, with the hope of
obtaining a view of the interior part of the country.  I directed my
people to proceed with all possible diligence, and that, if they met
with any accident, or found my return necessary, they should fire two
guns.  They also understood, that when they should hear the same signal
from me, they were to answer, and wait for me, if I were behind them.</p>

<p>When we had ascended to the summit of the hill, we found that it
extended onwards in an even, level country; so that, encumbered as we
were, with the thick wood, no distant view could be obtained; I
therefore climbed a very lofty tree, from whose top I discerned on the
right a ridge of mountains covered with snow, bearing about North-West;
from thence another ridge of high land, whereon no snow was visible,
stretched towards the South: between which and the snowy hills on the
East side, there appeared to be an opening, which we determined to be
the course of the river.</p>

<p>Having obtained all the satisfaction that the nature of the place would
admit, we proceeded forward to overtake the canoe, and after a warm walk
came down upon the river, when we discharged our pieces twice, but
received no answering signal.  I was of opinion, that the canoe was
before us, while the Indians entertained an opposite notion.  I,
however, crossed another point of land, and came again to the waterside
about ten.  Here we had a long view of the river, which circumstance
excited in my mind, some doubts of my former sentiments.  We repeated
our signals, but without any return; and as every moment now increased
my anxiety, I left Mr. Mackay and one of the Indians at this spot to
make a large fire, and sent branches adrift down the current as notices
of our situation, if the canoe was behind us; and proceeded with the
other Indian across a very long point, where the river makes a
considerable bend, in order that I might be satisfied if the canoe was
a-head.  Having been accustomed, for the last fortnight, to very cold
weather, I found the heat of this day almost insupportable, as our way
lay over a dry sand, which was relieved by no shade, but such as a few
scattered cypresses could afford us.  About twelve, we arrived once more
at the river, and the discharge of our pieces was as unsuccessful as it
had hitherto been.  The water rushed before us with uncommon velocity;
and we also tried the experiment of sending fresh branches down it.  To
add to the disagreeableness of our situation, the gnats and mosquitoes
appeared in swarms to torment us.  When we returned to our companions,
we found that they had not been contented with remaining in the position
where I had left them, but had been three or four miles down the river,
but were come back to their station, without having made any discovery
of the people on the water.</p>

<p>Various very unpleasing conjectures at once perplexed and distressed us:
the Indians, who are inclined to magnify evils of any and every kind,
had at once consigned the canoe and every one on board it to the bottom;
and were already settling a plan to return upon a raft, as well as
calculating the number of nights that would be required to reach their
home.  As for myself, it will be easily believed, that my mind was in a
state of extreme agitation, and the imprudence of my conduct in leaving
the people, in such a situation of danger and toilsome exertion added a
very painful mortification to the severe apprehensions I already
suffered: it was an act of indiscretion which might have put an end to
the voyage that I had so much at heart, and compelled me at length to
submit to the scheme which my hunters had already formed for our return.</p>

<p>At half past six in the evening, Mr. Mackay and the Cancre set off to
proceed down the river, as far as they could before the night came on,
and to continue their journey in the morning to the place where we had
encamped the preceding evening.  I also proposed to make my excursion
upwards; and, if we both failed of success in meeting the canoe, it was
agreed that we should return to the place where we now separated.</p>

<p>In this situation we had wherewithal to drink in plenty, but with solid
food we were totally unprovided.  We had not seen even a partridge
throughout the day, and the tracks of rein-deer that we had discovered,
were of an old date.  We were, however, preparing to make a bed of the
branches of trees, where we should have had no other canopy than that
afforded us by the heavens, when we heard a shot, and soon after
another, which was the notice agreed upon, if Mr. Mackay and the Indian
should see the canoe: that fortunate circumstance was also confirmed by
a return of the signal from the people.  I was, however, so fatigued
from the heat and exercise of the day, as well as incommoded from
drinking so much cold water, that I did not wish to remove till the
following morning; but the Indian made such bitter complaints of the
cold and hunger he suffered, that I complied with his solicitations to
depart; and it was almost dark when we reached the canoe, barefooted,
and drenched with rain.  But these inconveniences affected me very
little, when I saw myself once more surrounded with my people.  They
informed me, that the canoe had been broken; and that they had this day
experienced much greater toil and hardships than on any former occasion.
I thought it prudent to affect a belief of every representation that
they made, and even to comfort each of them with a consolatory dram:
for, however difficult the passage might have been, it was too short to
have occupied the whole day, if they had not relaxed in their exertions.
The rain was accompanied with thunder and lightning.</p>

<p>It appeared from the various encampments which we had seen, and from
several paddles we had found, that the natives frequent this part of the
country at the latter end of the summer and the fall.  The course to-day
was nearly East-South-East two miles and a half, South by West one mile,
South-South-East one mile and a half, East two miles, and South-East by
South one mile.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Thursday, 6.</i>&mdash;At half past four this morning we continued our
voyage, our courses being South-East by South one mile, East by South
three quarters of a mile, South-East by East two miles.  The whole of
this distance we proceeded by hauling the canoe from branch to branch.
The current was so strong, that it was impossible to stem it with the
paddles; the depth was too great to receive any assistance from the
poles, and the bank of the river was so closely lined with willows and
other trees, that it was impossible to employ the line.  As it was past
twelve before we could find a place that would allow of our landing, I
could not get a meridian altitude.  We occupied the rest of the day in
repairing the canoe, drying our cloaths, and making paddles and poles to
replace those which had been broken or lost.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friday, 7.</i>&mdash;The morning was clear and calm; and since we had been at
this station the water had risen two inches; so that the current became
still stronger; and its velocity had already been so great as to justify
our despair in getting up it, if we had not been so long accustomed to
surmount.  I last night observed an emersion of Jupiter's first
satellite, but inadvertently went to bed, without committing the exact
time to writing: if my memory is correct, it was 8. 18. 10. by the
timepiece.  The canoe, which had been little better than a wreck, being
now repaired, we proceeded East two miles and a quarter,
South-South-East half a mile, South-East a quarter of a mile, when we
landed to take an altitude for time.  We continued our route at
South-East by East three quarters of a mile, and landed again to
determine the latitude, which is 55. 2. 51.  To this I add, 2. 45.
Southing, which will make the place of taking altitude for time
55. 5. 36. with which I find that my time-piece was slow 1. 32. 23.
apparent time; and made the longitude obtained 122. 35. 50. West of
Greenwich.</p>

<p>From this place we proceeded East by South four miles and a half,
East-South-East one mile and a half, in which space there falls in a
small river from the East; East half a mile, South-East a mile and a
half, East a quarter of a mile, and encamped at seven o'clock.
Mr. Mackay and the hunters walked the greatest part of the day, and in
the course of their excursion killed a porcupine.<a name="v2-c4-hl1" href="#v2-c4-hr1">[1]</a> Here we found the
bed of a very large bear quite fresh.  During the day several Indian
encampments were seen, which were of a late erection.  The current had
also lost some of its impetuosity during the greater part of the day.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Saturday, 8.</i>&mdash;It rained and thundered through the night, and at four
in the morning we again encountered the current.  Our course was East a
quarter of a mile, round to South by East along a very high white sandy
bank on the East shore, three quarters of a mile, South-South-East a
quarter of a mile, South-South-West a quarter of a mile,
South-South-East one mile and a quarter, South-East two miles, with a
slack current; South-East by East two miles and a quarter, East a
quarter of a mile, South-South-East a quarter of a mile, South-East by
South four miles and a half, South-East one mile and a half,
South-South-West half a mile, East-North-East half a mile,
East-South-East a quarter of a mile, South-East by South one mile,
South-East by East half a mile, East by South three quarters of a mile,
when the mountains were in full view in this direction, and Eastward.
For the three last days we could only see them at short intervals and
long distances; but till then, they were continually in sight on either
side, from our entrance into the fork.  Those to the left were at no
great distance from us.</p>

<p>For the last two days we had been anxiously looking out for the
carrying-place, but could not discover it, and our only hope was in such
information as we should be able to procure from the natives.  All that
remained for us to do, was to push forwards till the river should be no
longer navigable: it had now, indeed, overflowed its banks, so that it
was eight at night before we could discover a place to encamp.  Having
found plenty of wild parsnips, we gathered the tops, and boiled them
with pemmican for our supper.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sunday, 9.</i>&mdash;The rain of this morning terminated in a heavy mist at
half past five, when we embarked and steered South-East one mile and a
half, when it veered North-North-East half a mile, South-East three
quarters of a mile, East by South three quarters of a mile,
East-South-East a quarter of a mile, South-South-East a quarter of a
mile, South-East by East one mile, North-East by East half a mile,
South-East by East half a mile, South-East by South three quarters of a
mile, South-East three quarters of a mile, East by South half a mile,
South-East by East half a mile, East-North-East three quarters of a
mile, when it veered to South-South-East half a mile, then back to East
(when a blue mountain, clear of snow, appeared a-head) one mile and a
half; North-East by East half a mile, East by North one mile, when it
veered to South-East half a mile, then on to North-West three quarters
of a mile, and back to North-East by East half a mile, South by West a
quarter of a mile, North-East by East to North-North-East half a mile,
South-South-East a quarter of a mile, and East by North half a mile;
here we perceived a smell of fire; and in a short time heard people in
the woods, as if in a state of great confusion, which was occasioned, as
we afterwards understood, by their discovery of us.  At the same time
this unexpected circumstance produced some little discomposure among
ourselves, as our arms were not in a state of preparation, and we were
as yet unable to ascertain the number of the party.  I considered, that
if there were but few, it would be needless to pursue them, as it would
not be probable that we should overtake them in these thick woods; and
if they were numerous, it would be an act of great imprudence to make
the attempt, at least during their present alarm.  I therefore ordered
my people to strike off to the opposite side, that we might see if any
of them had sufficient courage to remain; but, before we were half over
the river, which in this part is not more than a hundred yards wide, two
men appeared on a rising ground over against us, brandishing their
spears, displaying their bows and arrows, and accompanying their hostile
gestures with loud vociferations.  My interpreter did not hesitate to
assure them, that they might dispel their apprehensions, as we were
white people, who meditated no injury, but were, on the contrary,
desirous of demonstrating every mark of kindness and friendship.  They
did not, however, seem disposed to confide in our declarations, and
actually threatened, if we came over before they were more fully
satisfied of our peaceable intentions, that they would discharge their
arrows at us.  This was a decided kind of conduct which I did not
expect; at the same time I readily complied with their proposition, and
after some time had passed in hearing and answering their questions,
they consented to our landing, though not without betraying very evident
symptoms of fear and distrust.  They, however, laid aside their weapons,
and when I stepped forward and took each of them by the hand, one of
them, but with a very tremulous action, drew his knife from his sleeve,
and presented it to me as a mark of his submission to my will and
pleasure.  On our first hearing the noise of these people in the woods,
we displayed our flag, which was now shewn to them as a token of
friendship.  They examined us, and every thing about us, with a minute
and suspicious attention.  They had heard, indeed, of white men, but
this was the first time that they had ever seen a human being of a
complexion different from their own.  The party had been here but a few
hours; nor had they yet erected their sheds; and, except the two men now
with us, they had all fled, leaving their little property behind them.
To those which had given us such a proof of their confidence, we paid
the most conciliating attentions in our power.  One of them I sent to
recall his people, and the other, for very obvious reasons, we kept with
us.  In the mean time the canoe was unloaded, the necessary baggage
carried up the hill, and the tents pitched.</p>

<p>Here I determined to remain till the Indians became so familiarized to
us, as to give all the intelligence which we imagined might be obtained
from them.  In fact, it had been my intention to land where I might most
probably discover the carrying-place, which was our more immediate
object, and undertake marches of two or three days, in different
directions, in search of another river.  If unsuccessful in this
attempt, it was my purpose to continue my progress up the present river,
as far as it was navigable, and if we did not meet with natives to
instruct us in our further progress, I had determined to return to the
fork, and take the other branch, with the hope of better fortune.</p>

<p>It was about three in the afternoon when we landed, and at five the
whole party of Indians were assembled.  It consisted only of three men,
three women, and seven or eight boys and girls.  With their scratched
legs, bleeding feet, and dishevelled hair, as in the hurry of their
flight they had left their shoes and leggins behind them, they displayed
a most wretched appearance: they were consoled, however, with beads, and
other trifles, which seemed to please them; they had pemmican also given
them to eat, which was not unwelcome, and in our opinion, at least,
superior to their own provision, which consisted entirely of dried fish.</p>

<p>When I thought that they were sufficiently composed, I sent for the men
to my tent, to gain such information respecting the country as I
concluded it was in their power to afford me.  But my expectations were
by no means satisfied: they said that they were not acquainted with any
river to the Westward, but that there was one from whence they were just
arrived, over a carrying-place of eleven days march, which they
represented as being a branch only of the river before us.  Their
iron-work they obtained from the people who inhabit the bank of that
river, and an adjacent lake, in exchange for beaver skins, and dressed
moose skins.  They represented the latter as travelling, during a moon,
to get to the country of other tribes, who live in houses, with whom
they traffic for the same commodities; and that these also extend their
journies in the same manner to the sea coast, or, to use their
expression, the Stinking Lake, where they trade with people like us,
that come there in vessels as big as islands.  They added, that the
people to the Westward, as they have been told, are very numerous.
Those who inhabit the other branch they stated as consisting of about
forty families, while they themselves did not amount to more than a
fourth of that number; and were almost continually compelled to remain
in their strong holds, where they sometimes perished with cold and
hunger, to secure themselves from their enemies, who never failed to
attack them whenever an opportunity presented itself.</p>

<p>This account of the country, from a people who I had every reason to
suppose were well acquainted with every part of it, threatened to
disconcert the project on which my heart was set, and in which my whole
mind was occupied.  It occurred to me, however, that from fear, or other
motives, they might be tardy in their communication; I therefore assured
them that, if they would direct me to the river which I described to
them, I would come in large vessels, like those that their neighbours
had described, to the mouth of it, and bring them arms and ammunition in
exchange for the produce of their country; so that they might be able to
defend themselves against their enemies, and no longer remain in that
abject, distressed, and fugitive state in which they then lived.  I
added also, that in the mean time, if they would, on my return accompany
me below the mountains, to a country which was very abundant in animals,
I would furnish them, and their companions, with every thing they might
want; and make peace between them and the Beaver Indians.  But all these
promises did not appear to advance the object of my inquiries, and they
still persisted in their ignorance of any such river as I had mentioned,
that discharged itself into the sea.</p>

<p>In this state of perplexity and disappointment, various projects
presented themselves to my mind, which were no sooner formed than they
were discovered to be impracticable, and were consequently abandoned.
At one time I thought of leaving the canoe, and every thing it
contained, to go over land, and pursue that chain of connexion by which
these people obtain their iron-work; but a very brief course of
reflection convinced me that it would be impossible for us to carry
provisions for our support through any considerable part of such a
journey, as well as presents, to secure us a kind reception among the
natives, and ammunition for the service of the hunters, and to defend
ourselves against any act of hostility.  At another time my solicitude
for the success of the expedition incited a wish to remain with the
natives, and go to the sea by the way they had described; but the
accomplishment of such a journey, even if no accident should interpose,
would have required a portion of time which it was not in my power to
bestow.  In my present state of information, to proceed further up the
river was considered as a fruitless waste of toilsome exertion; and to
return unsuccessful, after all our labour, sufferings, and dangers, was
an idea too painful to indulge.  Besides, I could not yet abandon the
hope that the Indians might not yet be sufficiently composed and
confident, to disclose their real knowledge of the country freely and
fully to me.  Nor was I altogether without my doubts respecting the
fidelity of my interpreter, who being very much tired of the voyage,
might be induced to withhold those communications which would induce me
to continue it.  I therefore continued my attentions to the natives,
regaled them with such provisions as I had, indulged their children with
a taste of sugar, and determined to suspend my conversation with them
till the following morning.  On my expressing a desire to partake of
their fish, they brought me a few dried trout, well cured, that had been
taken in the river which they lately left.  One of the men also brought
me five beaver skins, as a present.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Monday, 10.</i>&mdash;The solicitude that possessed my mind interrupted my
repose; when the dawn appeared I had already quitted my bed, and was
waiting with impatience for another conference with the natives.  The
sun, however, had risen before they left their leafy bowers, whither
they had retired with their children, having most hospitably resigned
their beds, and the partners of them, to the solicitations of my young
men.</p>

<p>I now repeated my inquiries, but my perplexity was not removed by any
favourable variation in their answers.  About nine, however, one of
them, still remaining at my fire, in conversation with the interpreters,
I understood enough of his language to know that he mentioned something
about a great river, at the same time pointing significantly up that
which was before us.  On my inquiring of the interpreter respecting that
expression, I was informed that he knew of a large river, that runs
towards the mid-day sun, a branch of which flowed near the source of
that which we were now navigating; and that there were only three small
lakes, and as many carrying-places, leading to a small river, which
discharges itself into the great river, but that the latter did not
empty itself into the sea.  The inhabitants, he said, built houses,
lived on islands, and were a numerous and warlike people.  I desired him
to describe the road to the other river, by delineating it with a piece
of coal, on a strip of bark, which he accomplished to my satisfaction.
The opinion that the river did not discharge itself into the sea, I very
confidently imputed to his ignorance of the country.</p>

<p>My hopes were now renewed, and an object presented itself which awakened
my utmost impatience.  To facilitate its attainment, one of the Indians
was induced, by presents, to accompany me as a guide to the first
inhabitants, which we might expect to meet on the small lakes in our
way.  I accordingly resolved to depart with all expedition, and while my
people were making every necessary preparation, I employed myself in
writing the following description of the natives around me:</p>

<p>They are low in stature, not exceeding five feet six or seven inches;
and they are of that meagre appearance which might be expected in a
people whose life is one secession of difficulties, in procuring
subsistence.  Their faces are round, with high cheek bones; and their
eyes, which are small, are of a dark brown colour; the cartilage of
their nose is perforated, but without any ornaments suspended from it;
their hair is of a dingy black, hanging loose and in disorder over their
shoulders, but irregularly cut in the front, so as not to obstruct the
sight; their beards are eradicated, with the exception of a few
straggling hairs, and their complexion is a swarthy yellow.</p>

<p>Their dress consists of robes made of the skins of the heaver, the
ground-hog and the reindeer, dressed in the hair, and of the moose-skin
without it.  All of them are ornamented with a fringe, while some of
them have tassels hanging down the seams; those of the ground-hog are
decorated on the fur side with the tails of the animal, which they do
not separate from them.  Their garments they tie over the shoulders, and
fasten them round the middle with a belt of green skin, which is as
stiff as horn.  Their leggins are long, and, if they were topped with a
waistband, might be called trowsers: they, as well as their shoes, are
made of dressed moose, elk, or rein-deer skin.  The organs of generation
they leave uncovered.</p>

<p>The women differ little in their dress, from the men, except in the
addition of an apron, which is fastened round the waist, and hangs down
to the knees.  They are in general of a more lusty make than the other
sex, and taller in proportion, but infinitely their inferiors in
cleanliness.  A black artificial stripe crosses the face beneath the
eye, from ear to ear, which I first took for scabs, from the
accumulation of dirt on it.  Their hair, which is longer than that of
the men, is divided from the forehead to the crown, and drawn back in
long plaits behind the ears.  They have also a few white beads, which
they get where they procure their iron: they are from a line to an inch
in length, and are worn in their ears, but are not of European
manufacture.  These, with bracelets made of horn and bone, compose all
the ornaments which decorate their persons.  Necklaces of the grisly or
white bear's claws, are worn exclusively by the men.</p>

<p>Their arms consist of bows made of cedar, six feet in length, with a
short iron spike at one end, and serve occasionally as a spear.  Their
arrows are well made, barbed, and pointed with iron, flint, stone, or
bone; they are feathered, and from two or two feet and a half in length.
They have two kinds of spears, but both are double edged, and of well
polished iron; one of them is about twelve inches long, and two wide;
the other about half the width, and two thirds of the length; the shafts
of the first are eight feet in length, and the latter six.  They have
also spears made of bone.  Their knives consist of pieces of iron,
shaped and handled by themselves.  Their axes are something like our
adze, and they use them in the same manner as we employ that instrument.
They were, indeed, furnished with iron in a manner that I could not have
supposed, and plainly proved to me that their communication with those,
who communicate with the inhabitants of the sea coast, cannot be very
difficult, and from their ample provision of iron weapons, the means of
procuring it must be of a more distant origin than I had at first
conjectured.</p>

<p>They have snares made of green skin, which they cut to the size of
sturgeon twine, and twist a certain number of them together; and though
when completed they do not exceed the thickness of a cod-line, their
strength is sufficient to hold a moose-deer; they are from one and a
half to two fathoms in length.  Their nets and fishing-lines are made of
willow-bark and nettles; those made of the latter are finer and smoother
than if made with hempen thread.  Their hooks are small bones, fixed in
pieces of wood split for that purpose, and tied round with fine watape,
which has been particularly described in the former voyage.  Their
kettles are also made of watape, which is so closely woven that they
never leak, and they heat water in them, by putting red-hot stones into
it.  There is one kind of them, made of spruce-bark, which they hang
over the fire, but at such a distance as to receive the heat without
being within reach of the blaze; a very tedious operation.  They have
various dishes of wood and bark; spoons of horn and wood, and buckets;
bags of leather and net-work, and baskets of bark, some of which hold
their fishing-tackle, while others are contrived to be carried on the
back.  They have a brown kind of earth in great abundance, with which
they rub their clothes, not only for ornament but utility, as it
prevents the leather from becoming hard after it has been wetted.  They
have spruce bark in great plenty, with which they make their canoes, an
operation that does not require any great portion of skill or ingenuity,
and is managed in the following manner.&mdash;The bark is taken off the
tree the whole length of the intended canoe, which is commonly about
eighteen feet, and is sewed with watape at both ends; two laths are then
laid, and fixed along the edge of the bark which forms the gunwale; in
these are fixed the bars, and against them bear the ribs or timbers,
that are out to the length to which the bark can be stretched; and, to
give additional strength, strips of wood are laid between them: to make
the whole water-tight, gum is abundantly employed.  These vessels carry
from two to five people.  Canoes of a similar construction were used by
the Beaver Indians within these few years, but they now very generally
employ those made of the bark of the birch tree, which are by far more
durable.  Their paddles are about six feet long, and about one foot is
occupied by the blade, which is in the shape of an heart.</p>

<p>Previous to our departure, the natives had caught a couple of trout, of
about six pounds weight, which they brought me, and I paid them with
beads.  They likewise gave me a net, made of nettles, the skin of a
moose-deer, dressed, and a white horn in the shape of a spoon which
resembles the horn of the buffalo of the Copper-Mine-River; but their
description of the animal to which it belongs does not answer to that.
My young men also got two quivers of excellent arrows, a collar of white
bear's claws, of a great length, horn bracelets, and other articles, for
which they received an ample remuneration.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="v2-c4-hr1" href="#v2-c4-hl1">[1]</a> We had been obliged to indulge our hunters with sitting idle in the
canoe, lest their being compelled to share in the labour of navigating
it should disgust and drive them from us.  We, therefore, employed them
as much as possible on shore, as well to procure provisions, as to
lighten the canoe.</p>


<br>
<br>
<br>

<h4><a name="chapter5" href="#toc_chapter5"> CHAPTER V.</a></h4>

<p class="noindent">JUNE, 1793.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Monday, 10.</i>&mdash;At ten we were ready to embark.  I then took leave of
the Indians, but encouraged them to expect us in two moons, and
expressed an hope that I should find them on the road with any of their
relations whom they might meet.  I also returned the beaver skins to the
man who had presented them to me, desiring him to take care of them till
I came back, when I would purchase them of him.  Our guide expressed
much less concern about the undertaking in which he had engaged, than
his companions, who appeared to be affected with great solicitude for
his safety.</p>

<p>We now pushed off the canoe from the bank, and proceeded East half a
mile, when a river flowed in from the left, about half as large as that
which we were navigating.  We continued the same course three quarters
of a mile, when we missed two of our fowling pieces, which had been
forgotten, and I sent their owners back for them, who were absent on
this errand upwards of an hour.  We now proceeded North-East by East
half a mile, North-East by North three quarters of a mile, when the
current slackened; there was a verdant spot on the left, where, from the
remains of some Indian timber-work, it appeared, that the natives have
frequently encamped.  Our next course was East one mile, and we saw a
ridge of mountains covered with snow to the South-East.  The land on our
right was low and marshy for three or four miles, when it rose into a
range of heights that extended to the mountains.  We proceeded
East-South-East a mile and a half, South-East by East one mile, East by
South three quarters of a mile, South-East by East one mile, East by
South half a mile, North-East by East one mile, South-East half a mile,
East-North-East a mile and a quarter, South-South-East half a mile,
North-North-East a mile and a half: here a river flowed in from the
left, which was about one-fourth part as large as that which received
its tributary waters.  We then continued East by South half a mile, to
the foot of the mountain on the South of the above river.  The course
now veered short, South-West by West three quarters of a mile, East by
South a quarter of a mile, South half a mile, South-East by South half a
mile, South-West a quarter of a mile, East by South a quarter of a mile,
veered to West-North-West a quarter of a mile, South-West one eighth of
a mile, East-South-East one quarter of a mile, East one sixth of a mile,
South-South-West one twelfth of a mile, East-South-East one eighth of a
mile, North-East by East one third of a mile, East by North one twelfth
of a mile, North-East by East one third of a mile, East one sixteenth of
a mile, South-East one twelfth of a mile, North-East by East one twelfth
of a mile, East one eighth of a mile, and East-South-East half a mile,
when we landed at seven o'clock and encamped.  During the greatest part
of the distance we came to-day, the river runs close under the mountains
on the left.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Tuesday, 11.</i>&mdash;[<a name="tref1"
href="#tnote1">Transcriber's Note 1</a>] The morning was clear and cold.
On my interpreter's encouraging the guide to dispel all apprehension, to
maintain his fidelity to me, and not to desert in the night, "How is it
possible for me," he replied, "to leave the lodge of the Great
Spirit!&mdash;When he tells me that he has no further occasion for me, I
will then return to my children." As we proceeded, however, he soon
lost, and with good reason, his exalted notions of me.</p>


<p>At four we continued our voyage, steering East by South a mile and a
half, East-South-East half a mile.  A river appeared on the left, at the
foot of a mountain which, from its conical form, my young Indian called
the Beaver Lodge Mountain.  Having proceeded South-South-East half a
mile, another river appeared from the right.  We now came in a line with
the beginning of the mountains we saw yesterday: others of the same kind
ran parallel with them on the left side of the river, which was reduced
to the breadth of fifteen yards, and with a moderate current.</p>

<p>We now steered East-North-East one eighth of a mile, South-East by South
one eighth of a mile, East-South-East one sixth of a mile, South-West
one eighth of a mile, East-South-East one eighth of a mile,
South-South-East one sixth of a mile, North-East by East one twelfth of
a mile, East-South-East half a mile, South-West by West one third of a
mile, South-South-East one eighth of a mile, South-South-West one
quarter of a mile, North-East one sixth of a mile, South by West one
fourth of a mile, East three quarters of a mile, and North-East one
quarter of a mile.  Here the mountain on the left appeared to be
composed of a succession of round hills, covered with wood almost to
their summits, which were white with snow, and crowned with withered
trees.  We now steered East, in a line with the high lands on the right
five miles; North one twelfth of a mile, North-East by North one eighth
of a mile, South by East one sixteenth of a mile, North-East by North
one fourth of a mile, where another river fell in from the right;
North-East by East one sixth of a mile, East two miles and a half, South
one twelfth of a mile, North-East half a mile, South-East one third of a
mile, East one mile and a quarter, South-South-West one sixteenth of a
mile, North-East by East half a mile, East one mile and three quarters,
South and South-West by West half a mile, North-East half a mile, South
one third of a mile, North-East by North one sixth of a mile, East by
South one fourth of a mile, South one eighth of a mile, South-East three
quarters of a mile.  The canoe had taken in so much water, that it was
necessary for us to land here, in order to stop the leakage, which
occasioned the delay of an hour and a quarter, North-East a quarter of a
mile, East-North-East a quarter of a mile, South-East by South a
sixteenth of a mile, East by South a twelfth of a mile, North-East one
sixth of a mile, East-South-East one sixteenth of a mile, South-West
half a mile, North-East a quarter of a mile, East by South half a mile,
South-South-East one twelfth of a mile, East half a mile, North-East by
North a quarter of a mile, South-South-East a quarter of a mile,
North-East by North one twelfth of a mile, where a small river flowed in
from the left, South-East by East one twelfth of a mile, South by East a
quarter of a mile, South-East one eighth of a mile, East one twelfth of
a mile, North-East by North a quarter of a mile, South half a mile,
South-East by South one eighth of a mile, North-East one fourth of a
mile, South-East by East, and South-East by South one third of a mile,
East-South-East, and North-North-East one third of a mile, and South by
West, East and East-North-East one eighth of a mile.</p>

<p>Here we quitted the main branch, which, according to the information of
our guide, terminates at a short distance, where it is supplied by the
snow which covers the mountains.  In the same direction is a valley
which appears to be of very great depth, and is full of snow, that rises
nearly to the height of the land, and forms a reservoir of itself
sufficient to furnish a river, whenever there is a moderate degree of
heat.  The branch which we left was not, at this time, more than ten
yards broad, while that which we entered was still less.  Here the
current was very trifling, and the channel so meandering, that we
sometimes found it difficult to work the canoe forward.  The straight
course from this to the entrance of a small lake or pond, is about East
one mile.  This entrance by the river into the lake was almost choked up
by a quantity of drift-wood, which appeared to me to be an extraordinary
circumstance: but I afterwards found that it falls down from the
mountains.  The water, however, was so high, that the country was
entirely overflowed, and we passed with the canoe among the branches of
trees.  The principal wood along the banks is spruce, intermixed with a
few white birch, growing on detached spots, the intervening spaces being
covered with willow and elder.  We advanced about a mile in the lake,
and took up our station for the night at an old Indian encampment.  Here
we expected to meet with natives, but were disappointed; but our guide
encouraged us with the hope of seeing some on the morrow.  We saw beaver
in the course of the afternoon, but did not discharge our pieces from
the fear of alarming the inhabitants; there were also swans in great
numbers, with geese and ducks, which we did not disturb for the same
reason.  We observed also the tracks of moose-deer that had crossed the
river; and wild parsnips grew here in abundance, which have been already
mentioned as a grateful vegetable.  Of birds, we saw bluejays, yellow
birds, and one beautiful humming-bird; of the first and last, I had not
seen any since I had been in the North-West.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Wednesday, 12.</i>&mdash;[<A name="tref2"
href="#tnote2">Transcriber's Note 2</a>] The weather was the same  as
yesterday, and we proceeded between three and four in the morning.  We
took up the net which we had set the preceding evening, when it
contained a trout, one white fish, one carp, and three jub.  The lake is
about two miles in length, East by South, and from three to five hundred
yards wide.  This I consider as
the highest and
Southernmost source of the Unjigah, or Peace River, latitude,
54. 24. North, longitude 121. West from Greenwich, which, after a
winding course through a vast extent of country, receiving many large
rivers in its progress, and passing through the Slave Lake, empties
itself into the Frozen Ocean, in 70. North latitude, and about 135. West
longitude.</p>


<p>We landed and unloaded, where we found a beaten path leading over a low
ridge of land eight hundred and seventeen paces in length, to another
small lake.  The distance between the two mountains at this place is
about a quarter of a mile, rocky precipices presenting themselves on
both sides.  A few large spruce trees and liards were scattered over the
carrying-place.  There were also willows along the side of the water,
with plenty of grass and weeds.  The natives had left their old canoes
here, with baskets hanging on the trees, which contained various
articles.  From the latter I took a net, some hooks, a goat's-horn, and
a kind of wooden trap, in which, as our guide informed me, the
ground-hog is taken.  I left, however, in exchange, a knife, some
fire-steels, beads, awls, &amp;c.  Here two streams tumble down the rocks
from the right, and lose themselves in the lake which we had left; while
two others fall from the opposite heights, and glide into the lake which
we were approaching; this being the highest point of land dividing these
waters, and we are now going with the stream.  This lake runs in the
same course as the last, but is rather narrower, and not more than half
the length.  We were obliged to clear away some floating drift-wood to
get to the carrying-place, over which is a beaten path of only an
hundred and seventy-five paces long.  The lake empties itself by a small
river, which, if the channel were not interrupted by large trees that
had fallen across it, would have admitted of our canoe with all its
lading: the impediment, in deed, might have been removed by two axe-men
in a few hours.  On the edge of the water, we observed a large quantity
of thick yellow, scum or froth, of an acrid taste and smell.</p>

<p>We embarked on this lake, which is in the same course, and about the
same size as that which we had just left, and from whence we passed into
a small river, that was so full of fallen wood, as to employ some time,
and require some exertion, to force a passage.  At the entrance, it
afforded no more water than was just sufficient to bear the canoe; but
it was soon increased by many small streams which came in broken rills
down the rugged sides of the mountains, and were furnished, as I
suppose, by the melting of the snow.  These accessory streamlets had all
the coldness of ice.  Our course continued to be obstructed by banks of
gravel, as well as trees which had fallen across the river.  We were
obliged to force our way through the one, and to cut through the other,
at a great expense of time and trouble.  In many places the current was
also very rapid and meandering.  At four in the afternoon, we stopped to
unload and carry, and at five we entered a small round lake of about one
third of a mile in diameter.  From the last lake to this is, I think, in
a straight line, East by South six miles, though it is twice that
distance by the winding of the river.  We again entered the river, which
soon ran with great rapidity, and rushed impetuously over a bed of flat
stones.  At half past six we were stopped by two large trees that lay
across the river, and it was with great difficulty that the canoe was
prevented from driving against them.  Here we unloaded and formed our
encampment.</p>

<p>The weather was cloudy and raw, and as the circumstances of this day's
voyage had compelled us to be frequently in the water, which was cold as
ice, we were almost in a benumbed state.  Some of the people who had
gone ashore to lighten the canoe, experienced great difficulty in
reaching us, from the rugged state of the country; it was, indeed,
almost dark when they arrived.  We had no sooner landed than I sent two
men down the river to bring me some account of its circumstances, that I
might form a judgment of the difficulties which might await us on the
morrow; and they brought back a fearful detail of rapid currents, fallen
trees, and large stones.  At this place our guide manifested evident
symptoms of discontent: he had been very much alarmed in going down some
of the rapids with us, and expressed an anxiety to return.  He shewed us
a mountain, at no great distance, which he represented as being on the
other side of a river, into which this empties itself.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Thursday, 13.</i>&mdash;At an early hour of this morning the men began to cut
a road, in order to carry the canoe and lading beyond the rapid; and by
seven they were ready.  That business was soon effected, and the canoe
reladen, to proceed with the current which ran with great rapidity.  In
order to lighten her, it was my intention to walk with some of the
people; but those in the boat with great earnestness requested me to
embark, declaring, at the same time, that, if they perished, I should
perish with them.  I did not then imagine in how short a period their
apprehension would be justified.  We accordingly pushed off, and had
proceeded but a very short way when the canoe struck, and
notwithstanding all our exertions, the violence of the current was so
great as to drive her sideways down the river, and break her by the
first bar, when I instantly jumped into the water, and the men followed
my example; but before we could set her straight, or stop her, we came
to deeper water, so that we were obliged to re-embark with the utmost
precipitation.  One of the men who was not sufficiently active, was left
to get on shore in the best manner in his power.  We had hardly regained
our situations when we drove against a rock which shattered the stern of
the canoe in such a manner, that it held only by the gunwales, so that
the steersman could no longer keep his place.  The violence of this
stroke drove us to the opposite side of the river, which is but narrow,
when the bow met with the same fate as the stern.  At this moment the
foreman seized on some branches of a small tree in the hope of bringing
up the canoe, but such was their elasticity that, in a manner not easily
described, he was jerked on shore in an instant, and with a degree of
violence that threatened his destruction.  But we had no time to turn
from our own situation to enquire what had befallen him; for, in a few
moments, we came across a cascade which broke several large holes in the
bottom of the canoe, and started all the bars, except one behind the
scooping seat.  If this accident, however, had not happened, the vessel
must have been irretrievably overset.  The wreck becoming flat on the
water, we all jumped out, while the steersman, who had been compelled to
abandon his place, and had not recovered from his fright, called out to
his companions to save themselves.  My peremptory commands superseded
the effects of his fear, and they all held fast to the wreck; to which
fortunate resolution we owed our safety, as we should otherwise have
been dashed against the rocks by the force of the water, or driven over
the cascades.  In this condition we were forced several hundred yards,
and every yard on the verge of destruction; but, at length, we most
fortunately arrived in shallow water and a small eddy, where we were
enabled to make a stand, from the weight of the canoe resting on the
stones, rather than from any exertions of our exhausted strength.  For
though our efforts were short, they were pushed to the utmost, as life
or death depended on them.</p>

<p>This alarming scene, with all its terrors and dangers, occupied only a
few minutes; and in the present suspension of it, we called to the
people on shore to come to our assistance, and they immediately obeyed
the summons.  The foreman, however, was the first with us; he had
escaped unhurt from the extraordinary jerk with which he was thrown out
of the boat, and just as we were beginning to take our effects out of
the water, he appeared to give his assistance.  The Indians, when they
saw our deplorable situation, instead of making the least effort to help
us, sat down and gave vent to their tears.  I was on the outside of the
canoe, where I remained till every thing was got on shore, in a state of
great pain from the extreme cold of the water; so that at length, it was
with difficulty I could stand, from the benumbed state of my limbs.</p>

<p>The loss was considerable and important, for it consisted of our whole
stock of balls, and some of our furniture; but these considerations were
forgotten in the impressions of our miraculous escape.  Our first
inquiry was after the absent man, whom in the first moment of danger, we
had left to get on shore, and in a short time his appearance removed our
anxiety.  We had, however, sustained no personal injury of consequence,
and my bruises seemed to be in the greater proportion.</p>

<p>All the different articles were now spread out to dry.  The powder had
fortunately received no damage, and all my instruments had escaped.
Indeed, when my people began to recover from their alarm, and to enjoy a
sense of safety, some of them, if not all, were by no means sorry for
our late misfortune, from the hope that it must put a period to our
voyage, particularly as we were without a canoe, and all the bullets
sunk in the river.  It did not, indeed, seem possible to them that we
could proceed under these circumstances.  I listened, however, to the
observations that were made on the occasion without replying to them,
till their panic was dispelled, and they had got themselves warm and
comfortable, with an hearty meal, and rum enough to raise their spirits.</p>

<p>I then addressed them, by recommending them all to be thankful for their
late very narrow escape.  I also stated, that the navigation was not
impracticable in itself, but from our ignorance of its course; and that
our late experience would enable us to pursue our voyage with greater
security.  I brought to their recollection, that I did not deceive them,
and that they were made acquainted with the difficulties and dangers
they must expect to encounter, before they engaged to accompany me.  I
also urged the honour of conquering disasters, and the disgrace that
would attend them on their return home, without having attained the
object of the expedition.  Nor did I fail to mention the courage and
resolution which was the peculiar boast of the North men; and that I
depended on them, at that moment, for the maintenance of their
character.  I quieted their apprehension as to the loss of the bullets,
by bringing to their recollection that we still had shot from which they
might be manufactured.  I at the same time acknowledged the difficulty
of restoring the wreck of the canoe, but confided in our skill and
exertion to put it in such a state as would carry us on to where we
might procure bark, and build a new one.  In short, my harangue produced
the desired effect, and a very general assent appeared to go wherever I
should lead the way.</p>

<p>Various opinions were offered in the present posture of affairs, and it
was rather a general wish that the wreck should be abandoned, and all
the lading carried to the river, which our guide informed us was at no
great distance, and in the vicinity of woods where he believed there was
plenty of bark.  This project seemed not to promise that certainty to
which I looked in my present operations; besides, I had my doubts
respecting the views of my guide, and consequently could not confide in
the representation he made to me.  I therefore dispatched two of the men
at nine in the morning, with one of the young Indians, for I did not
venture to trust the guide out of my sight, in search of bark, and to
endeavor, if it were possible, in the course of the day, to penetrate to
the great river, into which that before us discharges itself in the
direction which the guide had communicated.  I now joined my people in
order to repair, as well as circumstances would admit, our wreck of a
canoe, and I began to set them the example.</p>

<p>At noon I had an altitude, which gave 54. 23. North latitude.  At four
in the afternoon I took time, with the hope that in the night I might
obtain an observation of Jupiter, and his satellites, but I had not a
sufficient horizon, from the propinquity of the mountains.  The result
of my calculation for the time was 1. 32. 28. slow apparent time.</p>

<p>It now grew late, and the people who had been sent on the excursion
already mentioned, were, not yet returned; about ten o'clock, however, I
heard a man halloo, and I very gladly returned the signal.  In a short
time our young Indian arrived with a small roll of indifferent bark: he
was oppressed with fatigue and hunger, and his clothes torn to rags: he
had parted with the other two men at sunset, who had walked the whole
day, in a dreadful country, without procuring any good bark, or being
able to get to the large river.  His account of the river, on whose
banks we were, could not be more unfavourable or discouraging; it had
appeared to him to be little more than a succession of falls and rapids,
with occasional interruptions of fallen trees.</p>

<p>Our guide became so dissatisfied and troubled in mind, that we could not
obtain from him any regular account of the country before us.  All we
could collect from him was, that the river into which this empties
itself, is but a branch of a large river, the great fork being at no
great distance from the confluence of this; and that he knew of no lake,
or large body of still water, in the vicinity of these rivers.  To this
account of the country, he added some strange, fanciful, but terrifying
descriptions of the natives, similar to those which were mentioned in
the former voyage.</p>

<p>We had an escape this day, which I must add to the many instances of
good fortune which I experienced in this perilous expedition.  The
powder had been spread out, to the amount of eighty pounds weight, to
receive the air; and, in this situation, one of the men carelessly and
composedly walked across it with a lighted pipe in his mouth, but
without any ill consequence resulting from such an act of criminal
negligence.  I need not add that one spark might have put a period to
all my anxiety and ambition.</p>

<p>I observed several trees and plants on the banks of this river, which I
had not seen to the North of the latitude 52. such as the cedar, maple,
hemlock, &amp;c.  At this time the water rose fast, and passed on with the
rapidity of an arrow shot from a bow.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friday 14.</i>&mdash;The weather was fine, clear, and warm, and at an early
hour of the morning we resumed our repair of the canoe.  At half past
seven our two men returned hungry and cold, not having tasted food, or
enjoyed the least repose for twenty-four hours, with their clothes torn
into tatters, and their skin lacerated, in passing through the woods.
Their account was the same as that brought by the Indian, with this
exception, that they had reason to think they saw the river, or branch
which our guide had mentioned: but they were of opinion that from the
frequent obstructions in this river, we should have to carry the whole
way to it, through a dreadful country, where much time and labour would
be required to open a passage through it.</p>

<p>Discouraging as these accounts were, they did not, however, interrupt
for a moment the task in which we were engaged, of repairing the canoe;
and this work we contrived to complete by the conclusion of the day.
The bark which was brought by the Indian, with some pieces of oil-cloth,
and plenty of gum, enabled us to put our shattered vessel in a condition
to answer our present purposes.  The guide, who has been mentioned as
manifesting continual signs of dissatisfaction, now assumed an air of
contentment, which I attributed to a smoke that was visible in the
direction of the river; as he naturally expected, if we should fall in
with any natives, which was now very probable, from such a circumstance,
that he should be released from a service which he had found so irksome
and full of danger.  I had an observation at noon, which made our
latitude 54. 23. 48.  North.  I also took time, and found it slow
apparent time 1. 38. 44.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Saturday, 15.</i>&mdash;The weather continued the same as the preceding day,
and according to the directions which I had previously given, my people
began at a very early hour to open a road, through which we might carry
a part of our lading; as I was fearful of risking the whole of it in the
canoe, in its present weak state, and in a part of the river which is
full of shoals and rapids.  Four men were employed to conduct her,
lightened as she was of twelve packages.  They passed several dangerous
places, and met with various obstructions, the current of the river
being frequently stopped by rafts of drift wood, and fallen trees, so
that after fourteen hours hard labour we had not made more than three
miles.  Our course was South-East by East, and as we had not met with
any accident, the men appeared to feel a renewed courage to continue
their voyage.  In the morning, however, one of the crew, whose name was
Beauchamp, peremptorily refused to embark in the canoe.  This being the
first example of absolute disobedience which had yet appeared during the
course of our expedition, I should not have passed it over without
taking some very severe means to prevent a repetition of it; but as he
had the general character of a simple fellow, among his companions, and
had been frightened out of what little sense he possessed, by our late
dangers, I rather preferred to consider him as unworthy of accompanying
us, and to represent him as an object of ridicule and contempt for his
pusillanimous behaviour; though, in fact, he was a very useful, active,
and laborious man.</p>

<p>At the close of the day we assembled round a blazing fire; and the whole
party, being enlivened with the usual beverage which I supplied on these
occasions, forgot their fatigues and apprehensions; nor did they fail to
anticipate the pleasure they should enjoy in getting clear of their
present difficulties, and gliding onwards with a strong and steady
stream, which our guide had described as the characteristic of the large
river we soon expected to enter.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sunday, 16.</i>&mdash;The fine weather continued, and we began our work, as
we had done the preceding day; some were occupied in opening a road,
others were carrying, and the rest employed in conducting the canoe.  I
was of the first party, and soon discovered that we had encamped about
half a mile above several falls, over which we could not attempt to run
the canoe, lightened even as she was.  This circumstance rendered it
necessary that the road should be made sufficiently wide to admit the
canoe to pass; a tedious and toilsome work.  In running her down a rapid
above the falls, a hole was broken in her bottom, which occasioned a
considerable delay, as we were destitute of the materials necessary for
her effectual reparation.  On my being informed of this misfortune, I
returned, and ordered Mr. Mackay, with two Indians, to quit their
occupation in making the road, and endeavour to penetrate to the great
river, according to the direction which the guide had communicated,
without paying any attention to the course of the river before us.</p>

<p>When the people had repaired the canoe in the best manner they were
able, we conducted her to the head of the falls; she was then unloaded
and taken out of the water, when we carried her for a considerable
distance through a low, swampy country.  I appointed four men to this
laborious office, which they executed at the peril of their lives, for
the canoe was now become so heavy, from the additional quantity of bark
and gum necessary to patch her up, that two men could not carry her more
than an hundred yards, without being relieved; and as their way lay
through deep mud, which was rendered more difficult by the roots and
prostrate trunks of trees, they were every moment in danger of falling;
and beneath such a weight, one false step might have been attended with
fatal consequences.  The other two men and myself followed as fast as we
could, with the lading.  Thus did we toil till seven o'clock in the
evening, to get to the termination of the road that had been made in the
morning.  Here Mr. Mackay and the Indian joined us, after having been at
the river, which they represented as rather large.  They had also
observed, that the lower part of the river before us was so full of
fallen wood, that the attempt to clear a passage through it, would be an
unavailing labour.  The country through which they had passed was
morass, and almost impenetrable wood.  In passing over one of the
embarras, our dog, which was following them, fell in, and it was with
very great difficulty that he was saved, as the current had carried him
under the drift.  They brought with them two geese, which had been shot
in the course of their expedition.  To add to our perplexities and
embarrassments, we were persecuted by mosquitoes and sand-flies, through
the whole of the day.</p>

<p>The extent of our journey was not more than two miles South-East; and so
much fatigue and pain had been suffered in the course of it, that my
people, as might be expected, looked forward to a continuance of it with
discouragement and dismay.  I was, indeed, informed that murmurs
prevailed among them, of which, however, I took no notice.  
When we were assembled together for the night, I gave each of them a
dram, and in a short time they retired to the repose which they so much
required.  We could discover the termination of the mountains at a
considerable distance on either side of us, which, according to my
conjecture, marked the course of the great river.  On the mountains to
the East there were several fires, as their smokes were very visible to
us.  Excessive heat prevailed throughout the day.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Monday, 17.</i>&mdash;Having sat up till twelve last night, which had been my
constant practice since we had taken our present guide, I awoke
Mr. Mackay to watch him in turn.  I then laid down to rest, and at three
I was awakened to be informed that he had deserted.  Mr. Mackay, with
whom I was displeased on this occasion, and the Cancre, accompanied by
the dog, went in search of him, but he had made his escape: a design
which he had for some time meditated, though I had done every thing in
my power to induce him to remain with me.</p>

<p>This misfortune did not produce any relaxation in our exertions.  At an
early hour of the morning we were all employed in cutting a passage of
three quarters of a mile, through which we carried our canoe and cargo,
when we put her into the water with her lading, but in a very short time
were stopped by the drift-wood, and were obliged to land and carry.  In
short, we pursued our alternate journeys, by land and water, till noon,
when we could proceed no further, from the various small unnavigable
channels into which the river branched in every direction; and no other
mode of getting forward now remained for us, but by cutting a road
across a neck of land.  I accordingly dispatched two men to ascertain
the exact distance, and we employed the interval of their absence in
unloading and getting the canoe out of the water.  It was eight in the
evening when we arrived at the bank of the great river.  This journey
was three quarters of a mile East-North-East, through a continued swamp,
where, in many places, we waded up to the middle of our thighs.  Our
course in the small river was about South-East by East three miles.  At
length we enjoyed, after all our toil and anxiety, the inexpressible
satisfaction of finding ourselves on the bank of a navigable river, on
the West side of the first great range of mountains.</p>

<h4><a name="chapter6" href="#toc_chapter6"> CHAPTER VI.</a></h4>

<p class="noindent">JUNE, 1793.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Tuesday, 18.</i>&mdash;It rained throughout the night and till seven in the
morning; nor was I sorry that the weather gave me an excuse for
indulging my people with that additional rest, which their fatigues,
during the last three days, rendered so comfortable to them.  Before
eight, however, we were on the water, and driven on by a strong current,
when we steered East-South-East half a mile, South-West by South half a
mile, South-South-East half a mile, South-West half a mile, went round
to North-West half a mile, backed South-South-East three quarters of a
mile, South-South-West half a mile, South by East a quarter of a mile,
and South-West by South three quarters of a mile.  Here the water had
fallen considerably, so that several mud and sand-banks were visible.
There was also a hill a-head, West-South-West.</p>

<p>The weather was so hazy that we could not see across the river, which is
here about two hundred yards wide.  We now proceeded South by West one
third of a mile, when we saw a considerable quantity of beaver work
along the banks, North-North-West half a mile, South-West by West one
mile and a half, South-South-West one third of a mile, West by South one
third of a mile, South by East half a mile.  Mountains rose on the left,
immediately above the river, whose summits were covered with snow;
South-West half a mile, South a quarter of a mile, South-East one third
of a mile, South-South-West half a mile.  Here are several islands; we
then veered to West by South a third of a mile, South-South-East a sixth
of a mile.  On the right, the land is high, rocky, and covered with
wood; West-South-West one mile; a small river running in from the
South-East; South-West half a mile, South three quarters of a mile,
South-West half a mile, South by West half a mile.  Here a rocky point
protrudes from the left, and narrows the river to a hundred yards;
South-East half a mile, East by South one eighth of a mile.  The current
now was very strong, but perfectly safe; South-East by South an eighth
of a mile, West by North one third of a mile, South by West a twelfth of
a mile, South-West one fourth of a mile.  Here the high land terminates
on one side of the river, while rocks rise to a considerable height
immediately above the other, and the channel widens to a hundred and
fifty yards, West by South one mile.  The river now narrows again
between rocks of a moderate height, North-North-East an eighth of a
mile, veered to South-West an eighth of a mile, South and South-West
half a mile.  The country appeared to be low, as far as I could judge of
it from the canoe, as the view is confined by woods at the distance of
about a hundred yards from the banks.  Our course continued West by
North two miles, North half a mile, North-West a quarter of a mile,
South-West two miles, North-West three quarters of a mile; when a ridge
of high land appeared in this direction; West one mile.  A small river
flowed in from the North; South a quarter of a mile, North-West half a
mile, South-South-West two miles and a half, South-East three quarters
of a mile; a rivulet lost itself in the main stream, West-North-West
half a mile.  Here the current slackened, and we proceeded
South-South-West three quarters of a mile, South-West three quarters of
a mile, South by East three quarters of a mile, South-East by East one
mile, when it veered gradually to West-North-West half a mile; the river
being full of islands.  We proceeded due North, with little current, the
river presenting a beautiful sheet of water for a mile and a half,
South-West by West one mile, West-North-West one mile, when it veered
round to South-East one mile, West by North one mile, South-East one
mile, West by North three quarters of a mile, South one eighth of a
mile, when we came to an Indian cabin of late erection.  Here was the
great fork, of which our guide had informed us, and it appeared to be
the largest branch from the South-East.  It is about half a mile in
breadth, and assumes the form of a lake.  The current was very slack,
and we got into the middle of the channel, when we steered West, and
sounded in sixteen feet water.</p>

<p>A ridge of high land now stretched on, as it were, across our present
direction: this course was three miles.  We then proceeded
West-South-West two miles, and sounded in twenty-four feet water.  Here
the river narrowed and the current increased.  We then continued our
course North-North-West three quarters of a mile, a small river falling
in from the North-East.  It now veered to South by West one mile and a
quarter, West-South-West four miles and a half, West by North one mile
and a quarter, North-West by West one mile, West a mile and a quarter:
the land was high on both sides, and the river narrowed to an hundred
and fifty, or two hundred yards; North-West three quarters of a mile,
South-West by South two miles and a half: here its breadth again
increased; South by West one mile, West-South-West half a mile,
South-West by South three miles, South-South-East one mile, with a small
river running in from the left, South with a strong current one mile,
then East three quarters of a mile, South-West one mile,
South-South-East a mile and a half; the four last distances being a
continual rapid, South-West by West one mile, East-North-East a mile and
a half, East-South-East one mile, where a small river flowed in on the
right; South-West by South two miles and a half, when another small
river appeared from the same quarter; South by East half a mile and
South-West by West one mile and a quarter: here we landed for the night.
When we had passed the last river we observed smoke rising from it, as
if produced by fires that had been fresh lighted; I therefore concluded
that there were natives on its banks: but I was unwilling to fatigue my
people, by pulling back against the current in order to go in search of
them.</p>

<p>This river appeared, from its high water-mark, to have fallen no more
than one foot, while the smaller branch, from a similar measurement, had
sunk two feet and a half.  On our entering it, we saw a flock of ducks
which were entirely white, except the bill and part of the wings.  The
weather was cold and raw throughout the day, and the wind South-West.
We saw a smoke rising in columns from many parts of the woods, and I
should have been more anxious to see the natives, if there had been any
person with me who could have introduced me to them; but as that object
could not be then attained without considerable loss of time, I
determined to pursue the navigation while it continued to be so
favourable, and to wait till my return, if no very convenient
opportunity offered in the mean time, to engage an intercourse with
them.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Wednesday, 19.</i>&mdash;The morning was foggy, and at three we were on the
water.  At half past that hour, our course was East by South three
quarters of a mile, a small river flowing in from the right.  We then
proceeded South by East half a mile, and South-South-West a mile and a
half.  During the last distance, clouds of thick smoke rose from the
woods, that darkened the atmosphere, accompanied with a strong odour of
the gum of cypress and the spruce-fir.  Our courses continued to be
South-West a mile and a quarter, North-West by West three quarters of a
mile, South-South-East a mile and a quarter, East three quarters of a
mile, South-West one mile, West by South three quarters of a mile,
South-East by South three quarters of a mile, South by West half a mile,
West by South three quarters of a mile, South by West two miles and a
half.  In the last course there was an island, and it appeared to me,
that the main channel of the river had formerly been on the other side
of it.  The banks were here composed of high white cliffs, crowned with
pinnacles in very grotesque shapes.  We continued to steer South-East by
South a mile and a half, South by East half a mile, East one mile and a
quarter, South-East by East one mile, South by East three quarters of a
mile, South-East by East one mile, South-South-East half a mile, East
one mile and a quarter, South by East half a mile, East a mile and half,
South-South-East three miles, and South-West three quarters of a mile.
In the last course the rocks contracted in such a manner on both sides
of the river, as to afford the appearance of the upper part of a fall or
cataract.  Under this apprehension we landed on the left shore, where we
found a kind of footpath, imperfectly traced, through which we
conjectured that the natives occasionally passed with their canoes and
baggage.  On examining the course of the river, however, there did not
appear to be any fall as we expected; but the rapids were of a
considerable length and impassable for a light canoe.  We had therefore
no alternative but to widen the road so as to admit the passage of our
canoe, which was now carried with great difficulty; as from her frequent
repairs, and not always of the usual materials, her weight was such,
that she cracked and broke on the shoulders of the men who bore her.
The labour and fatigue of this undertaking, from eight till twelve,
beggars all description, when we at length conquered this afflicting
passage, of about half a mile, over a rocky and most rugged hill.  Our
course was South-South-West.  Here I took a meridian altitude which gave
me 53. 42. 20. North latitude.  We, however, lost some time to put our
canoe in a condition to carry us onwards.  Our course was South a
quarter of a mile to the next carrying-place; which was nothing more
than a rocky point about twice the length of the canoe.  From the
extremity of this point to the rocky and almost perpendicular bank that
rose on the opposite shore, is not more than forty or fifty yards.  The
great body of water, at the same time tumbling in successive cascades
along the first carrying-place, rolls through this narrow passage in a
very turbid current, and full of whirlpools.  On the banks of the river
there was great plenty of wild onions, which when mixed up with our
pemmican was a great improvement of it; though they produced a physical
effect on our appetites, which was rather inconvenient to the state of
our provisions.</p>

<p>Here we embarked, and steered South-East by East three quarters of a
mile.  We now saw a smoke on the shore; but before we could reach land
the natives had deserted their camp, which appeared to be erected for no
more than two families.  My two Indians were instantly dispatched in
search of them, and, by following their tracks, they soon overtook them;
but their language was mutually unintelligible; and all attempts to
produce a friendly communication were fruitless.  They no sooner
perceived my young men than they prepared their bows and arrows, and
made signs for them not to advance; and they thought it prudent to
desist from proceeding, though not before the natives had discharged
five arrows at them, which, however, they avoided, by means of the
trees.  When they returned with this account, I very much regretted that
I had not accompanied them; and as these people could not be at any very
great distance, I took Mr. Mackay, and one of the Indians with me in
order to overtake them; but they had got so far it would have been
imprudent in me to have followed them.  My Indians, who, I believe, were
terrified at the manner in which these natives received them, informed
me, that, besides their bows, arrows, and spears, they were armed with
long knives, and that they accompanied their strange antics with
menacing actions and loud shoutings.  On my return, I found my people
indulging their curiosity in examining the bags and baskets which the
natives had left behind them.  Some of them contained their fishing
tackle, such as nets, lines, &amp;c., others of a smaller size were filled
with a red earth, with which they paint themselves.  In several of the
bags there were also sundry articles of which we did not know the use.
I prevented my men from taking any of them; and for a few articles of
mere curiosity, which I took myself, I left such things in exchange as
would be much more useful to their owners.</p>

<p>At four we left this place, proceeding with the stream South-East three
quarters of a mile, East-South-East one mile, South three quarters of a
mile, South-South-West one mile, South by East three quarters of a mile,
South-South-East one mile, South-South-West two miles, South-South-East
three miles and a quarter, East by North one mile, South-South-East one
mile and a quarter, with a rapid, South-South-West three quarters of a
mile, South one mile and a half, South-East one mile and a quarter,
South three quarters of a mile, and South-South-East one mile and a
half.  At half past seven we landed for the night, where a small river
flowed in from the right.  The weather was showery, accompanied with
several loud claps of thunder.  The banks were overshadowed by lofty
firs, and wide-spreading cedars.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Thursday, 20.</i>&mdash;The morning was foggy, and at half past four we
proceeded with a South wind, South-East by East two miles,
South-South-East two miles and a half, and South-South-West two miles.
The fog was so thick, that we could not see the length of our canoe,
which rendered our progress dangerous, as we might have come suddenly
upon a cascade or violent rapid.  Our next course was West-North-West
two miles and a half, which comprehended a rapid.  Being close in with
the left bank of the river, we perceived two red deer at the very edge
of the water: we killed one of them, and wounded the other, which was
very small.  We now landed, and the Indians followed the wounded animal,
which they soon caught, and would have shot another in the woods, if our
dog, who followed them, had not disturbed it.  From the number of their
tracks it appeared that they abounded in this country.  They are not so
large as the elk of the Peace River, but are the real red deer, which I
never saw in the North, though I have been told that they are to be
found in great numbers in the plains along the Red, or Assiniboin River.
The bark had been stripped off many of the spruce trees, and carried
away, as I presumed, by the natives, for the purpose of covering their
cabins.  We now got the venison on board, and continued our voyage
South-West one mile, South a mile and a half, and West one mile.  Here
the country changed its appearance; the banks were but of a moderate
height, from whence the ground continued gradually rising to a
considerable distance, covered with poplars and cypresses, but without
any kind of underwood.  There are also several low points which the
river, that is here about three hundred yards in breadth, sometimes
overflows, and are shaded with the liard, the soft birch, the spruce,
and the willow.  For some distance before we came to this part of the
river, our view was confined within very rugged, irregular, and lofty
banks, which were varied with the poplar, different kinds of spruce fir,
small birch trees, cedars, alders, and several species of the willow.
Our next course was South-West by West six miles, when we landed at a
deserted house, which was the only Indian habitation of this kind that I
had seen on this side of Mechilimakina.  It was about thirty feet long
and twenty wide, with three doors, three feet high by one foot and an
half in breadth.  From this and other circumstances, it appears to have
been constructed for three families.  There were also three fire-places,
at equal distances from each other; and the beds were on either side of
them.  Behind the beds was a narrow space, in the form of a manger, and
somewhat elevated, which was appropriated to the purpose of keeping
fish.  The wall of the house, which was five feet in height, was formed
of very strait spruce timbers, brought close together, and laid into
each other at the corners.  The roof was supported by a ridge pole,
resting on two upright forks of about ten feet high; that and the wall
support a certain number of spars, which are covered with spruce bark;
and the whole attached and secured by the fibers of the cedar.  One of
the gable ends is closed with split boards; the other with poles.  Large
rods are also fixed across the upper part of the building, where fish
may hang and dry.  To give the walls additional strength, upright posts
are fixed in the ground, at equal distances, both within and without, of
the same height as the wall, and firmly attached with bark fibres.
Openings appear also between the logs in the wall, for the purpose, as I
conjectured, of discharging their arrows at a besieging enemy; they
would be needless for the purpose of giving light, which is sufficiently
afforded by fissures between the logs of the building, so that it
appeared to be constructed merely for a summer habitation.  There was
nothing further to attract our attention in or about the house, except a
large machine, which must have rendered the taking off the roof
absolutely necessary, in order to have introduced it.  It was of a
cylindrical form, fifteen feet long, and four feet and an half in
diameter; one end was square, like the head of a cask, and an conical
machine was fixed inwards to the other end, of similar dimensions; at
the extremity of which was an opening of about seven inches in diameter.
This machine was certainly contrived to set in the river, to catch large
fish; and very well adapted to that purpose; as when they are once in,
it must be impossible for them to get out, unless they should have
strength sufficient to break through it.  It was made of long pieces of
split wood, rounded to the size of a small finger, and placed at the
distance of an inch asunder, on six hoops; to this was added a kind of
boot of the same materials, into which it may be supposed that the fish
are driven, when they are to be taken out.  The house was left in such
apparent order as to mark the design of its owners to return thither.
It answered in every particular the description given us by our late
guide, except that it was not situated on an island.</p>

<p>We left this place, and steered South by East one mile and a quarter
when we passed where there had been another house, of which the
ridge-pole and supporters alone remained: the ice had probably carried
away the body of it.  The bank was at this time covered with water, and
a small river flowed in on the left.  On a point we observed an erection
that had the appearance of a tomb; it was in an oblong form, covered,
and very neatly walled with bark.  A pole was fixed near it, to which,
at the height of ten or twelve feet, a piece of bark was attached, which
was probably a memorial, or symbol of distinction.  Our next course was
South by West two miles and a half, when we saw a house on an island,
South-East by East one mile and three quarters, in which we observed
another island, with a house upon it.  A river also flowed from the
right, and the land was high and rocky, and wooded with the epinette.</p>

<p>Our canoe was now become so crazy that it was a matter of absolute
necessity to construct another; and as from the appearance of the
country there was reason to expect that bark was to be found, we landed
at eight, with the hope of procuring it.  I accordingly dispatched four
men with that commission, and at twelve they returned with a sufficient
quantity to make the bottom of a canoe of five fathom in length, and
four feet and a half in height.  At noon I had an observation, which
gave me 53. 17. 28. North latitude.</p>

<p>We now continued our voyage South-East by South one mile and a half,
East-South-East one mile, East-North-East half a mile, South-East two
miles, South-East by South one mile, South-East six miles, and
East-North-East.  Here the river narrows between steep rocks, and a
rapid succeeded, which was so violent that we did not venture to run it.
I therefore ordered the loading to be taken out of the canoe, but she
was now become so heavy that the men preferred running the rapid to the
carrying her overland.  Though I did not altogether approve of their
proposition, I was unwilling to oppose it.  Four of them undertook this
hazardous expedition, and I hastened to the foot of the rapid with great
anxiety, to wait the event, which turned out as I expected.  The water
was so strong, that although they kept clear of the rocks, the canoe
filled, and in this state they drove half way down the rapid, but
fortunately she did not overset; and having got her into an eddy, they
emptied her, and in an half-drowned condition arrived safe on shore.
The carrying-place is about half a mile over, with an Indian path across
it.  Mr. Mackay, and the hunters, saw some deer on an island above the
rapid; and had that discovery been made before the departure of the
canoe, there is little doubt but we should have added a considerable
quantity of venison to our stock of provisions.  Our vessel was in such
a wretched condition, as I have already observed, that it occasioned a
delay of three hours to put her in a condition to proceed.  At length we
continued our former course, East-North-East a mile and a half, when we
passed an extensive Indian encampment; East-South-East one mile, where a
small river appeared on the left; South-East by South one mile and three
quarters, East by South half a mile, East by North one mile, and saw
another house on an island; South half a mile, West three quarters of a
mile, South-West half a mile, where the cliffs of white and red clay
appeared like the ruins of ancient castles.  Our canoe now veered
gradually to East-North-East one mile and a half, when we landed in a
storm of rain and thunder, where we perceived the remains of Indian
houses.  It was impossible to determine the wind in any part of the day,
as it came a-head in all our directions.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friday, 21.</i>&mdash;As I was very sensible of the difficulty of procuring
provisions in this country, I thought it prudent to guard against any
possibility of distress of that kind on our return; I therefore ordered
ninety pounds weight of pemmican to be buried in a hole, sufficiently
deep to admit of a fire over it without doing any injury to our hidden
treasure, and which would, at the same time, secure it from the natives
of the country, or the wild animals of the woods.</p>

<p>The morning was very cloudy, and at four o'clock we renewed our voyage,
steering South by East one mile and a quarter, East-South-East half a
mile, South by East one mile and a half, East half a mile, South-East
two miles, where a large river flowed in from the left, and a smaller
one from the right.  We then continued South by West three quarters of a
mile, East by South a mile and a half, South three quarters of a mile,
South-East by East one mile, South by East half a mile, South-East three
quarters of a mile, South-East by South half a mile, South-East by East
half a mile, the cliffs of blue and yellow clay, displaying the same
grotesque shapes as those which we passed yesterday, South-South-East a
mile and a half, South by East two miles.  The latitude by observation
was 52. 47. 51. North.</p>

<p>Here we perceived a small new canoe, that had been drawn up to the edge
of the woods, and soon after another appeared, with one man in it, which
came out of a small river.  He no sooner saw us than he gave the whoop
to alarm his friends, who immediately appeared on the bank, armed with
bows and arrows, and spears.  They were thinly habited, and displayed
the most outrageous antics.  Though they were certainly in a state of
great apprehension, they manifested by their gestures that they were
resolved to attack us, if we should venture to land.  I therefore
ordered the men to stop the way of the canoe, and even to check her
drifting with the current, as it would have been extreme folly to have
approached these savages before their fury had in some degree subsided.
My interpreters, who understood their language, informed me that they
threatened us with instant death if we drew nigh the shore; and they
followed the menace by discharging a volley of arrows, some of which
fell short of the canoe, and others passed over it, so that they
fortunately did us no injury.</p>

<p>As we had been carried by the current below the spot where the Indians
were, I ordered my people to paddle to the opposite side of the river,
without the least appearance of confusion, so that they brought me
abreast of them.  My interpreters, while we were within hearing, had
done every thing in their power to pacify them, but in vain.  We also
observed that they had sent off a canoe with two men, down the river, as
we concluded, to communicate their alarm, and procure assistance.  This
circumstance determined me to leave no means untried that might engage
us in a friendly intercourse with them, before they acquired additional
security and confidence, by the arrival of their relations and
neighbours, to whom their situation would be shortly notified.</p>

<p>I therefore formed the following adventurous project, which was happily
crowned with success.  I left the canoe, and walked by myself along the
beach, in order to induce some of the natives to come to me, which I
imagined they might be disposed to do, when they saw me alone, without
any apparent possibility of receiving assistance from my people, and
would consequently imagine that a communication with me was not a
service of danger.  At the same time, in order to possess the utmost
security of which my situation was susceptible, I directed one of the
Indians to slip into the woods, with my gun and his own, and to conceal
himself from their discovery; he also had orders to keep as near me as
possible, without being seen; and if any of the natives should venture
across, and attempt to shoot me from the water, it was his instructions
to lay him low: at the same time he was particularly enjoined not to
fire till I had discharged one or both of the pistols that I carried in
my belt.  If, however, any of them were to land, and approach my person,
he was immediately to join me.  In the meantime my other interpreter
assured them that we entertained the most friendly dispositions, which I
confirmed by such signals as I conceived would be comprehended by them.
I had not, indeed, been long at my station, and my Indian in ambush
behind me, when two of the natives came off in a canoe, but stopped when
they had got within a hundred yards of me.  I made signs for them to
land, and as an inducement, displayed looking-glasses, beads, and other
alluring trinkets.  At length, but with every mark of extreme
apprehension, they approached the shore, stern foremost, but would not
venture to land.  I now made them a present of some beads, with which
they were going to push off, when I renewed my entreaties, and, after
some time, prevailed on them to come ashore, and sit down by me.  My
hunter now thought it right to join me, and created some alarm in my new
acquaintance.  It was, however, soon removed, and I had the satisfaction
to find, that he and these people perfectly understood each other.  I
instructed him to say every thing that might tend to soothe their fears
and win their confidence.  I expressed my wish to conduct them to our
canoe, but they declined my offer; and when they observed some of my
people coming towards us, they requested me to let them return; and I
was so well satisfied with the progress I had made in my intercourse
with them, that I did not hesitate a moment in complying with their
desire.  During their short stay, they observed us, and every thing
about us, with a mixture of admiration and astonishment.  We could
plainly distinguish that their friends received them with great joy on
their return, and that the articles which they carried back with them
were examined with a general and eager curiosity; they also appeared to
hold a consultation, which lasted about a quarter of an hour, and the
result was, an invitation to come over to them, which was cheerfully
accepted.  Nevertheless, on our landing they betrayed evident signs of
confusion, which arose probably from the quickness of our movements, as
the prospect of a friendly communication had so cheered the spirits of
my people, that they paddled across the river with the utmost
expedition.  The two men, however, who had been with us, appeared, very
naturally, to possess the greatest share of courage on the occasion, and
were ready to receive us on our landing; but our demeanour soon
dispelled all their apprehensions, and the most familiar communication
took place between us.  When I had secured their confidence, by the
distribution of trinkets among them, and treated the children with
sugar, I instructed my interpreters to collect every necessary
information in their power to afford me.</p>

<p>According to their account, this river, whose course is very extensive,
runs towards the mid-day sun; and that at its mouth, as they had been
informed, white people were building houses.  They represented its
current to be uniformly strong, and that in three places it was
altogether impassable, from the falls and rapids, which poured along
between perpendicular rocks that were much higher, and more rugged, than
any we had yet seen, and would not admit of any passage over them.  But
besides the dangers and difficulties of the navigation, they added, that
we should have to encounter the inhabitants of the country, who were
very numerous.  They also represented their immediate neighbours as a
very malignant race, who lived in large subterraneous recesses; and when
they were made to understand that it was our design to proceed to the
sea, they dissuaded us from prosecuting our intention, as we should
certainly become a sacrifice to the savage spirit of the natives.  These
people they described as possessing iron, arms, and utensils, which they
procured from their neighbours to the Westward, and were obtained by a
commercial progress from people like ourselves, who brought them in
great canoes.</p>

<p>Such an account of our situation, exaggerated as it might be in some
points, and erroneous in others, was sufficiently alarming, and awakened
very painful reflections: nevertheless it did not operate on my mind so
as to produce any change in my original determination.  My first object,
therefore, was to persuade two of these people to accompany me, that
they might secure to us a favourable reception from their neighbours.
To this proposition they assented, but expressed some degree of
dissatisfaction at the immediate departure, for which we were making
preparation; but when we were ready to enter the canoe, a small one was
seen doubling the point below, with three men in it.  We thought it
prudent to wait for their arrival, and they proved to be some of their
relations, who had received the alarm from the messengers which I have
already mentioned as having been sent down the river for that purpose,
and who had passed on, as we were afterwards informed, to extend the
notice of our arrival.  Though these people saw us in the midst of their
friends, they displayed the most menacing actions, and hostile postures.
At length, however, this wild, savage spirit appeared to subside, and
they were persuaded to land.  One of them, who was a middle aged person,
whose agitations had been less frequent than those of his companions,
and who was treated with particular respect by them all, inquired who we
were, whence we came, whither we were going, and what was the motive of
our coming into that country.  When his friends had satisfied him as far
as they were able, respecting us, he instantly advised us to delay our
departure for that night, as their relations below, having been by this
time alarmed by the messengers, who had been sent for that purpose,
would certainly oppose our passage, notwithstanding I had two of their
own people with me.  He added, that they would all of them be here by
sunset, they would convinced, as he was, that we were good people, and
meditated no ill designs against them.</p>

<p>Such were the reasons which this Indian urged in favour of our remaining
till the next morning; and they were too well founded for me to hesitate
in complying with them; besides, by prolonging my stay till the next
morning, it was probable that I might obtain some important intelligence
respecting the country through which I was to pass, and the people who
inhabited it.  I accordingly ordered the canoe to be unloaded, taken out
of the water, and gummed.  My tent was also pitched, and the natives
were now become so familiar, that I was obliged to let them know my wish
to be alone and undisturbed.</p>

<p>My first application to the native whom I have already particularly
mentioned, was to obtain from him such a plan of the river as he should
be enabled to give me; and he complied with this request with a degree
of readiness and intelligence that evidently proved it was by no means a
new business to him.  In order to acquire the best information he could
communicate, I assured him, if I found his account correct, that I
should either return myself, or send others to them, with such articles
as they appeared to want: particularly arms and ammunition, with which
they would be able to prevent their enemies from invading them.  I
obtained, however, no addition to what I already knew, but that the
country below us, as far as he was acquainted with it, abounded in
animals, and that the river produced plenty of fish.</p>

<p>Our canoe was now become so weak, leaky, and unmanageable, that it
became a matter of absolute necessity to construct a new one; and I had
been informed, that if we delayed that important work till we got
further down the river, we should not be able to procure bark.  I
therefore dispatched two of my people, with an Indian, in search of that
necessary material.  The weather was so cloudy that I could not get an
observation.<a name="v2-c6-hl1" href="#v2-c6-hr1">[1]</a></p>

<p>I passed the rest of the day in conversing with these people: they
consisted of seven families, containing eighteen men, they were clad in
leather, and handsome beaver and rabbit-skin blankets.  They had not
been long arrived in this part of the country, where they proposed to
pass the summer, to catch fish for their winter provision: for this
purpose they were preparing machines similar to that which we found in
the first Indian house we saw and described.  The fish which they take
in them are large, and only visit this part of the river at certain
seasons.  These people differ very little, if at all, either in their
appearance, language, or manners, from the Rocky-Mountain Indians.  The
men whom I sent in search of bark, returned with a certain quantity of
it, but of a very indifferent kind.  We were not gratified with the
arrival of any of the natives whom we expected from a lower part of the
river.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Saturday, 22.</i>&mdash;At six in the morning we proceeded on our voyage,
with two of the Indians, one of them in a small pointed canoe, made
after the fashion of the Esquimaux, and the other in our own.  This
precaution was necessary in a two-fold point of view, as the small canoe
could be sent ahead to speak to any of the natives that might be seen
down the river, and, thus divided, would not be easy for them both to
make their escape.  Mr. Mackay also embarked with the Indian, which
seemed to afford him great satisfaction, and he was thereby enabled to
keep us company with diminution of labour.</p>

<p>Our courses were South-South-East a mile and a half, South-East half a
mile, South by East four miles and a half, South-East by South half a
mile, South by West half a mile, South-East by East one mile,
South-South-West a mile and a half, South by East one mile and a
quarter.  The country, on the right, presented a very beautiful
appearance: it rose at first rather abruptly to the height of
twenty-five feet, when the precipice was succeeded by an inclined plain
to the foot of another steep; which was followed by another extent of
gently-rising ground: these objects, which were shaded with groves of
fir, presenting themselves alternately to a considerable distance.</p>

<p>We now landed near a house, the roof of which alone appeared above
ground; but it was deserted by its inhabitants who had been alarmed at
our approach.  We observed several men in the second steep, who
displayed the same postures and menacing actions as those which we have
so lately described.  Our conductors went to them immediately on an
embassy of friendship, and, after a very vociferous discourse, one of
them was persuaded to come to us, but presented a very ferocious aspect:
the rest, who were seven in number, soon followed his example.  They
held their bows and arrows in their hands, and appeared in their
garments, which were fastened round the neck, but left the right arm
free for action.  A cord fastened a blanket or leather covering under
the right armpit, so that it hung upon the left shoulder, and might be
occasionally employed as a target, that would turn an arrow which was
nearly spent.  As soon as they had recovered from their apprehensions,
ten women made their appearance, but without any children, whom, I
imagine, they had sent to a greater distance, to be out of reach of all
possible danger.  I distributed a few presents among them, and left my
guides to explain to them the object of my journey, and the friendliness
of my designs, with which they had themselves been made acquainted;
their fears being at length removed, I gave them a specimen of the use
to which we applied our firearms: at the same time, I calmed their
astonishment, by the assurance, that, though we could at once destroy
those who did us injury, we could equally protect those who shewed us
kindness.  Our stay here did not exceed half an hour, and we left these
people with favourable impressions of us.</p>

<p>From this place we steered East by North half a mile, South by East
three quarters of a mile, and South by West a mile and a half, when we
landed again on seeing some of the natives on the high ground, whose
appearance was more wild and ferocious than any whom we had yet seen.
Indeed I was under some apprehension that our guides, who went to
conciliate them to us, would have fallen a prey to their savage fury.
At length, however, they were persuaded to entertain a more favourable
opinion of us, and they approached us one after another, to the number
of sixteen men, and several women, I shook hands with them all, and
desired my interpreters to explain that salutation as a token of
friend-ship.  As this was not a place where we could remain with the
necessary convenience, I proposed to proceed further, in search of a
more commodious spot.  They immediately invited us to pass the night at
their lodges, which were at no great distance, and promised, at the same
time, that they would, in the morning, send two young men to introduce
us to the next nation, who were very numerous, and ill-disposed towards
strangers.  As we were pushing from the shore, we were very much
surprised at hearing a woman pronounce several words in the Knisteneaux
language.  She proved to be a Rocky Mountain native, so that my
interpreters perfectly understood her.  She informed us that her country
is at the forks of this river, and that she had been taken prisoner by
the Knisteneaux, who had carried her across the mountains.  After having
passed the greatest part of the summer with them, she had contrived to
escape, before they had reached their own country, and had re-crossed
the mountains, when she expected to meet her own friends: but after
suffering all the hardships incident to such a journey, she had been
taken by a war-party of the people with whom she then was, who had
driven her relations from the river into the mountains.  She had since
been detained by her present husband, of whom she had no cause to
complain; nevertheless she expressed a strong desire to return to her
own people.  I presented her with several useful articles, and desired
her to come to me at the lodges, which she readily engaged to do.  We
arrived thither before the Indians, and landed, as we had promised.  It
was now near twelve at noon, but on attempting to take an altitude, I
found the angle too great for my sextant.</p>

<p>The natives whom we had already seen, and several others, soon joined
us, with a greater number of women than I had yet seen; but I did not
observe the female prisoner among them.  There were thirty-five of them,
and my remaining store of presents was not sufficient to enable me to be
very liberal to so many claimants.  Among the men I found four of the
adjoining nation, and a Rocky-Mountain Indian, who had been with them
for some time.  As he was understood by my interpreters, and was himself
well acquainted with the language of the strangers, I possessed the
means of obtaining every information respecting the country, which it
might be in their power to afford me.  For this purpose I selected an
elderly man, from the four strangers, whose countenance had prepossessed
me in his favour.  I stated to these people, as I had already done to
those from whom I had hitherto derived information, the objects of my
voyage, and the very great advantages which they would receive from my
successful termination of it.  They expressed themselves very much
satisfied at my communication, and assured me that they would not
deceive me respecting the subject of my inquiry.  An old man also, who
appeared to possess the character of a chief, declared his wish to see
me return to his land, and that his two young daughters should then be
at my disposal.  I now proceeded to request the native, whom I had
particularly selected, to commence his information, by drawing a sketch
of the country upon a large piece of bark, and he immediately entered on
the work, frequently appealing to, and sometimes asking the advice of,
those around him.  He described the river as running to the East of
South, receiving many rivers, and every six or eight leagues encumbered
with falls and rapids, some of which were very dangerous, and six of
them impracticable.  The carrying-places he represented as of great
length, and passing over hills and mountains.  He depicted the lands of
three other tribes, in succession, who spoke different languages.
Beyond them he knew nothing either of the river or country, only that it
was still a long way to the sea; and that, as he had heard, there was a
lake, before they reached the water, which the natives did not drink.
As far as his knowledge of the river extended, the country on either
side was level, in many places without wood and abounding in red deer,
and some of a small fallow kind.  Few of the natives, he said, would
come to the banks for some time; but, that at a certain season they
would arrive there in great numbers, to fish.  They now procured iron,
brass, copper, and trinkets, from the Westward; but formerly these
articles were obtained from the lower parts of the river, though in
small quantities.  A knife was produced which had been brought from that
quarter.  The blade was ten inches long, and an inch and a half broad,
but with a very blunted edge.  The handle was of horn.  We understood
that this instrument had been obtained from white men, long before they
had heard that any came to the Westward.  One very old man observed,
that as long as he could remember, he was told of white people to the
Southward; and that he had heard, though he did not vouch for the truth
of the report, that one of them had made an attempt to come up the
river, and was destroyed.</p>

<p>These people describe the distance across the country as very short to
the Western ocean; and, according to my own idea, it cannot be above
five or six degrees.  If the assertion of Mr. Mears be correct, it
cannot be so far, as the inland sea which he mentions within Nootka,
must come as far East as 126.  West longitude.  They assured us that the
road was not difficult as they avoided the mountains, keeping along the
low lands between them, many parts of which are entirely free from wood.
According to their account, this way is so often travelled by them, that
their path is visible throughout the whole journey, which lies along
small lakes and rivers.  It occupied them, they said, no more than six
nights, to go to where they meet the people who barter iron, brass,
copper, beads, &amp;c., with them, for dressed leather, and beaver, bear,
lynx, fox, and marten skins.  The iron is about eighteen inches of
two-inch bar.  To this they give an edge at one end, and fix it to a
handle at right angles, which they employ as an axe.  When the iron is
worn down, they fabricate it into points for their arrows and pikes.
Before they procured iron they employed bone and horn for those
purposes.  The copper and brass they convert into collars, arm-buds,
bracelets, and other ornaments.  They sometimes also point their arrows
with those metals.  They had been informed by those whom they meet to
trade with, that the white people, from whom these articles are
obtained, were building houses at the distance of three days, or two
nights journey from the place where they met last fall.  With this route
they all appeared to be well acquainted.</p>

<p>I now requested that they would send for the female prisoner whom I saw
yesterday; but I received only vague and evasive answers.  They probably
apprehended, that it was our design to take her from them.  I was,
however, very much disappointed at being prevented from having an
interview with her, as she might have given me a correct account of the
country beyond the forks of the river, as well as of the pass, through
the mountains, from them.</p>

<p>My people had listened with great attention to the relation which had
been given me, and it seemed to be their opinion, that it would be
absolute madness to attempt a passage through so many savage and
barbarous nations.  My situation may indeed, be more easily conceived
than expressed: I had no more than thirty days provision remaining,
exclusive of such supplies as I might obtain from the natives, and the
toil of our hunters, which, however, was so precarious as to be matter
of little dependence: besides, our ammunition would soon be exhausted,
particularly our ball, of which we had not more than a hundred and
fifty, and about thirty pound weight of shot, which, indeed, might be
converted into bullets, though with great waste. </p>

<p>The more I heard of the river, the more I was convinced it could not
empty itself into the ocean to the North of what is called the river of
the West, so that with its windings, the distance must be very great.  Such being the
discouraging circumstances of my situation, which were now heightened by
the discontents of my people, I could not but be alarmed at the idea of
attempting to get to the discharge of such a rapid river, especially
when I reflected on the tardy progress of my return up it, even if I
should meet with no obstruction from the natives; a circumstance not
very probable, from the numbers of them which would then be on the
river, and whom I could have no opportunity of conciliating in my
passage down, for the reasons which have been already mentioned.  At all
events, I must give up every expectation of returning this season to
Athabasca.  Such were my reflections at this period; but instead of
continuing to indulge them, I determined to proceed with resolution, and
set future events at defiance.  At the same time I suffered myself to
nourish the hope that I might be able to penetrate with more safety, and
in a shorter period, to the ocean by the inland western communication.</p>

<p>To carry this project into execution I must have returned a considerable
distance up the river, which would necessarily be attended with very,
serious inconvenience, if I passed over every other; as in a voyage of
this kind, a retrograde motion could not fail to cool the ardour,
slacken the zeal and weaken the confidence of those, who have no greater
inducement to the undertaking, than to follow the conductor of it.  Such
was the state of my mind at this period, and such the circumstances with
which it was distressed and distracted.</p>

<p>To the people who had given me the foregoing information I presented
some beads, which they preferred to any other articles in my possession,
and I recompensed in the same manner two of them who communicated to me
the following vocabulary in the language of the Nagailer and Atnah
tribes.</p>

<p>The Atnah language has no affinity to any with which I am acquainted;
but the Nagailer differs very little from that spoken by the Beaver
Indians, and is almost the same as that of the Chepewyans.</p>

<p>We had a thunder-storm with heavy rain; and in the evening when it had
subsided, the Indians amused us with singing and dancing, in which they
were joined by the young women.  Four men now arrived whom we had not
yet seen; they had left their families at some distance in the country,
and expressed a desire that we should visit them there.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sunday, 23.</i>&mdash;After a restless night, I called the Indians together,
from whom I yesterday received the intelligence which has been already
mentioned, in the hope that I might obtain some additional information.
From their former account they did not make the least deviation; but
they informed me further, that where they left this river, a small one
from the Westward falls into it, which was navigable for their canoes
during four days, and from thence they slept but two nights, to get to
the people with whom they trade, and who have wooden canoes much larger
than ours, in which they go down a river to the sea.  They continued to
inform me, that if I went that way we must leave our own canoe behind
us; but they thought it probable that those people would furnish us with
another.  From thence they stated the distance to be only one day's
voyage with the current to the lake whose water is nauseous, and where
they had heard that great canoes came two winters ago, and that the
people belonging to them, brought great quantities of goods and built
houses.</p>

<p>At the commencement of this conversation, I was very much surprised by
the following question from one of the Indians: "What," demanded he,
"can be the reason that you are so particular and anxious in your
inquiries of us respecting a knowledge of this country: do not you white
men know every thing in the world?" This interrogatory was so very
unexpected, that it occasioned some hesitation before I could answer it.
At length, however, I replied, that we certainly were acquainted with
the principal circumstances of every part of the world; that I knew
where the sea is, and where I myself then was, but that I did not
exactly understand what obstacles might interrupt me in getting to it;
with which, he and his relations must be well acquainted, as they had so
frequently surmounted them.  Thus I fortunately preserved the impression
in their minds, of the superiority of white people over themselves.</p>

<p>It was now, however, absolutely necessary that I should come to a final
determination which route to take; and no long interval of reflection
was employed, before I preferred to go over land: the comparative
shortness and security of such a journey, were alone sufficient to
determine me.  I accordingly proposed to two of the Indians to accompany
me, and one of them readily assented to my proposition.</p>

<p>I now called those of my people about me, who had not been present at my
consultation with the natives; and after passing a warm eulogium on
their fortitude, patience, and perseverance, I stated the difficulties
that threatened our continuing to navigate the river, the length of time
it would require, and the scanty provision we had for such a voyage: I
then proceeded for the foregoing reasons to propose a shorter route, by
trying the overland road to the sea.  At the same time, as I knew from
experience, the difficulty of retaining guides, and as many
circumstances might occur to prevent our progress in that direction, I
declared my resolution not to attempt it, unless they would engage if we
could not after all proceed over land, to return with me, and continue
our voyage to the discharge of the waters, whatever the distance might
be.  At all events, I declared, in the most solemn manner, that I would
not abandon my design of reaching the sea, if I made the attempt alone,
and that I did not despair of returning in safety to my friends.</p>

<p>This proposition met with the most zealous return, and they unanimously
assured me, that they were as willing now as they had ever been, to
abide by my resolutions, whatever they might be, and to follow me
wherever I should go.  I therefore requested them to prepare for an
immediate departure, and at the same time gave notice to the man who had
engaged to be our guide, to be in readiness to accompany us.  When our
determination to return up the river was made known, several of the
natives took a very abrupt departure; but to those who remained, I gave
a few useful articles, explaining to them at the same time, the
advantages that would result to them, if their relations conducted me to
the sea, along such a road as they had described.  I had already given a
moose skin to some of the women for the purpose of making shoes, which
were now brought us; they were well sewed but ill-shaped, and a few
beads were considered as a sufficient remuneration for the skill
employed on them, Mr. Mackay, by my desire, engraved my name, and the
date of the year on a tree.</p>

<p>When we were ready to depart, our guide proposed, for the sake of
expedition, to go over land to his lodge, that he might get there before
us, to make some necessary preparation for his journey.  I did not
altogether relish his design, but was obliged to consent: I thought it
prudent, however, to send Mr. Mackay, and the two Indians along with
him.  Our place of rendezvous, was the subterraneous house which we
passed yesterday.</p>

<p>At ten in the morning we embarked, and went up the current much faster
than I expected with such a crazy vessel as that which carried us.  We
met our people at the house as had been appointed; but the Indian still
continued to prefer going on by land, and it would have been needless
for me to oppose him.  He proceeded, therefore, with his former
companions, whom I desired to keep him in good humour by every
reasonable gratification.  They were also furnished with a few articles
that might be of use if they should meet strangers.</p>

<p>In a short time after we had left the house, I saw a wooden canoe coming
down the river, with three natives in it, who, as soon as they perceived
us, made for the shore, and hurried into the woods.  On passing their
vessel, we discovered it to be one of those which we had seen at the
lodges.  A severe gust of wind, with rain, came from the
South-South-East.  This we found to be a very prevalent wind in these
parts.  We soon passed another wooden canoe drawn stern foremost on the
shore; a circumstance which we had not hitherto observed.  The men
worked very hard, and though I imagined we went a-head very fast, we
could not reach the lodges, but landed for the night at nine, close to
the encampment of two families of the natives whom we had formerly seen
at the lodges.  I immediately went and sat down with them, when they
gave some roasted fish; two of my men who followed me were gratified
also with some of their provisions.  The youngest of the two natives now
quitted the shed, and did not return during the time I remained there.
I endeavoured to explain to the other by signs, the cause of my sudden
return, which he appeared to understand.  In the mean time my tent was
pitched, and on my going to it, I was rather surprised that he did not
follow me, as he had been constantly with me during the day and night I
had passed with his party on going down.  We, however, went to rest in a
state of perfect security; nor had we the least apprehension for the
safety of our people who were gone by land.</p>

<p>We were in our canoe by four this morning, and passed by the Indian hut,
which appeared in a state of perfect tranquillity.  We soon came in
sight of the point where we first saw the natives, and at eight were
much surprised and disappointed at seeing Mr. Mackay, and our two
Indians coming alone from the ruins of a house that had been partly
carried away by the ice and water, at a short distance below the place
where we had appointed to meet.  Nor was our surprise and apprehension
diminished by the alarm which was painted in their countenances.  When
we had landed, they informed me that they had taken refuge in that
place, with the determination to sell their lives, which they considered
in the most imminent danger, as dear as possible.  In a very short time
after they had left us, they met a party of the Indians, whom we had
known at this place, and were probably those whom we had seen to land
from their canoe.  They appeared to be in a state of extreme rage, and
had their bows bent, with their arrows across them.  The guide stopped
to ask them some questions, which my people did not understand, and then
set off with his utmost speed.  Mr. Mackay, however, did not leave him
till they were both exhausted with running.  When the young man came up,
he then said, that some treacherous design was meditated against them,
as he was induced to believe from the declaration of the natives, who
told him that they were going to do mischief, but refused to name the
enemy.  The guide then conducted them through very bad ways, as fast as
they could run; and when he was desired to slacken his pace, he answered
that they might follow him in any manner they pleased, but that he was
impatient to get to his family, in order to prepare shoes, and other
necessaries, for his journey.  They did not, however, think it prudent
to quit him, and he would not stop till ten at night.  On passing a
track that was but lately made, they began to be seriously alarmed, and
on inquiring of the guide where they were, he pretended not to
understand them.  They then all laid down, exhausted with fatigue, and
without any kind of covering: they were cold, wet, and hungry, but dared
not light a fire, from the apprehension of an enemy.  This comfortless
spot they left at the dawn of the day, and, on their arrival at the
lodges, found them deserted; the property of the Indians being scattered
about, as if abandoned for ever.  The guide then made two or three trips
into the woods, calling aloud, and bellowing like a madman.  At length
he set off in the same direction as they came, and had not since
appeared.  To heighten their misery, as they did not find us at the
place appointed, they concluded that we were all destroyed, and had
already formed their plan to take to the woods, and cross in as direct a
line as they could proceed, to the waters of the Peace River, a scheme
which could only be suggested by despair.  They intended to have waited
for us till noon, and if we did not appear by that time, to have entered
without further delay on their desperate expedition.</p>

<p>This alarm among the natives was a very unexpected as well as perilous
event, and my powers of conjecture were exhausted in searching for the
cause of it.  A general panic seized all around me, and any further
prosecution of the voyage was now considered by them as altogether
hopeless and impracticable.  But without paying the least attention to
their opinions or surmises, I ordered them to take every thing out of
the canoe, except six packages: when that was done, I left four men to
take care of the lading, and returned with the others to our camp of
last night, where I hoped to find the two men, with their families, whom
we had seen there, and to be able to bring them to lodge with us, when I
should wait the issue of this mysterious business.  This project,
however, was disappointed, for these people had quitted their sheds in
the silence of the night, and had not taken a single article of their
little property with them.</p>

<p>These perplexing circumstances made a deep
impression on my mind, not as to our immediate safety, for I entertained
not the least apprehension of the Indians I had hitherto seen, even if
their whole force should have been combined to attack us, but these
untoward events seemed to threaten the prosecution of my journey; and I
could not reflect on the possibility of such a disappointment but with
sensations little short of agony.  Whatever might have been the wavering
disposition of the people on former occasions, they were now decided in
their opinions as to the necessity of returning without delay; and when
we came back to them, their cry was&mdash;"Let us re-embark, and be gone."
This, however, was not my design, and in a more peremptory tone than I
usually employed, they were ordered to unload the canoe, and take her
out of the water.  On examining our property, several articles appeared
to be missing, which the Indians must have purloined; and among them
were an axe, two knives, and the young men's bag of medicines.  We now
took a position that was the best calculated for defence, got our arms
in complete order, filled each man's flask of powder, and distributed an
hundred bullets, which were all that remained, while some were employed
in melting down shot to make more.  The weather was so cloudy, <p>that I
had not an opportunity of taking an observation.</p>

<p>While we were employed in making these preparations, we saw an Indian in
a canoe come down the river, and land at the huts, which he began to
examine.  On perceiving us he stood still, as if in a state of suspense,
when I instantly dispatched one of my Indians towards him, but no
persuasions could induce him to have confidence in us; he even
threatened that he would hasten to join his friends, who would come and
kill us.  At the conclusion of this menace he disappeared.  On the
return of my young man, with this account of the interview, I pretended
to discredit the whole, and attributed it to his own apprehensions and
alarms.  This, however, he denied, and asked with a look and tone of
resentment, whether he had ever told me a lie?  Though he was but a
young man, he said, he had been on war excursions before he came with
me, and that he should no longer consider me as a wise man, which he had
hitherto done.</p>

<p>To add to our distresses we had not an ounce of gum for the reparation
of the canoe, and not one of the men had sufficient courage to venture
into the woods to collect it.  In this perplexing situation I
entertained the hope that in the course of the night some of the natives
would return, to take away a part <p>at least of the things which they had
left behind them, as they had gone away without the covering necessary
to defend them from the weather and the flies.  I therefore ordered the
canoe to be loaded, and dropped to an old house, one side of which, with
its roof, had been carried away by the water; but the three remaining
angles were sufficient to shelter us from the woods.  I then ordered two
strong piquets to be driven into the ground, to which the canoe was
fastened, so that if we were hard pressed we had only to step on board
and push off.  We were under the necessity of making a smoke to keep off
the swarms of flies, which would have otherwise tormented us; but we did
not venture to excite a blaze, as it would have been a mark for the
arrows of the enemy.  Mr. Mackay and myself, with three men kept
alternate watch, and allowed the Indians to do as they fancied.  I took
the first watch, and the others laid down in their clothes by us.  I
also placed a centinel at a small distance, who was relieved every hour.
The weather was cloudy, with showers of rain.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Tuesday, 25.</i>&mdash;At one I called up the other watch, and laid down to a
small portion of broken rest.  At five I arose, and as the situation
which we left yesterday was preferable to that which we then occupied, I
determined to return to it.  On our arrival Mr. Mackay <p>informed me that
the men had expressed their dissatisfaction to him in a very unreserved
manner, and had in very strong terms declared their resolution to follow
me no further in my proposed enterprise.  I did not appear, however, to
have received such communications from him, and continued to employ my
whole thoughts in contriving means to bring about a reconciliation with
the natives, which alone would enable me to procure guides, without
whose assistance it would be impossible for me to proceed, when my
darling project would end in disappointment.</p>

<p>At twelve we saw a man coming with the stream upon a raft, and he must
have discovered us before we perceived him, as he was working very hard
to get to the opposite shore, where he soon landed, and instantly fled
into the woods.  I now had a meridional altitude, which gave
60. 23. natural horizon (the angle being more than the sextant could
measure with the artificial horizon) one mile and a half distant; and
the eye five feet above the level of the water, gave 62. 47. 51.  North
latitude.</p>

<p>While I was thus employed, the men loaded the canoe, without having
received any orders from me, and as this was the first time they had
ventured to act in such a decided manner, I naturally concluded that
they had <p>preconcerted a plan for their return.  I thought it prudent,
however, to take no notice of this transaction, and to wait the issue of
future circumstances.  At this moment our Indians perceived a person in
the edge of the woods above us, and they were immediately dispatched to
discover who it was.  After a short absence they returned with a young
woman whom we had seen before: her language was not clearly comprehended
by us, so that we could not learn from her, at least with any degree of
certainty, the cause of this unfortunate alarm that had taken place
among the natives.  She told us that her errand was to fetch some things
which she had left behind her; and one of the dogs whom we found here,
appeared to acknowledge her as his mistress.  We treated her with great
kindness, gave her something to eat, and added a present of such
articles as we thought might please her.  On her expressing a wish to
leave us, we readily consented to her departure, and indulged the hope
that her reception would induce the natives to return in peace, and give
us an opportunity to convince them, that we had no hostile designs
whatever against them.  On leaving us, she went up the river, without
taking a single article of her own, and the dog followed.  The wind was
changeable throughout the day, and <p>there were several showers in the
course of it.</p>

<p>Though a very apparent anxiety prevailed among the people for their
departure, I appeared to be wholly inattentive to it, and at eight in
the evening I ordered four men to step into the canoe, which had been
loaded for several hours, and drop down to our guard-house, and my
command was immediately obeyed: the rest of us proceeded there by land.
When I was yet at a considerable distance from the house, and thought it
impossible for an arrow to reach it, having a bow and quiver in my hand,
I very imprudently let fly an arrow, when, to my astonishment and
infinite alarm, I heard it strike a log of the house.  The men who had
just landed, imagined that they were attacked by an enemy from the
woods.  Their confusion was in proportion to their imaginary danger, and
on my arrival I found that the arrow had passed within a foot of one of
the men; though it had no point, the weapon, incredible as it may
appear, had entered an hard, dry log of wood upwards of an inch.  But
this was not all: for the men readily availed themselves of this
circumstance, to remark upon the danger of remaining in the power of a
people possessed of such means of destruction.  Mr. Mackay having the
first watch, I laid myself down in my cloak.</p>


<br><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Wednesday, 26.</i>&mdash;At midnight a rustling noise was heard in the woods
which created a general alarm, and I was awakened to be informed of the
circumstance, but heard nothing.  At one I took my turn of the watch,
and our dog continued unceasingly to run backwards and forwards along
the skirts of the wood in a state of restless vigilance.  At two in the
morning the centinel informed me, that he saw something like an human
figure creeping along on all-fours about fifty paces above us.  After
some time had passed in our search, I at length discovered that his
information was true, and it appeared to me that a bear had occasioned
the alarm; but when day appeared, it proved to be an old, grey-haired,
blind man, who had been compelled to leave his hiding-place by extreme
hunger, being too infirm to join in the flight of the natives to whom he
belonged.  When I put my hand on this object of decaying nature, his
alarm was so great, that I expected it would have thrown him into
convulsions.  I immediately led him to our fire which had been just
lighted, and gave him something to eat, which he much wanted, as he had
not tasted food for two days.  When his hunger was satisfied, and he had
got warm and composed, I requested him to acquaint me with the cause of
that alarm which had taken place respecting us among his relations and
friends, whose regard we appeared to have conciliated but a few days
past.  He replied, that very soon after we had left them, some natives
arrived from above, who informed them that we were enemies; and our
unexpected return, in direct contradiction to our own declarations,
confirmed them in that opinion.  They were now, he said, so scattered,
that a considerable time would elapse, before they could meet again.  We
gave him the real history of our return, as well as of the desertion of
our guide, and, at the same time, stated the impossibility of our
proceeding, unless we procured a native to conduct us.  He replied, that
if he had not lost his sight, he would with the greatest readiness have
accompanied us on our journey.  He also confirmed the accounts which we
had received of the country, and the route to the Westward.  I did not
neglect to employ every argument in my power, that he might be persuaded
of our friendly dispositions to the inhabitants wheresoever we might
meet them.</p>

<p>At sun-rise we perceived a canoe with one man in it on the opposite side
of the river, and at our request, the blind man called to him to come to
us, but he returned no answer, and continued his course as fast as he
could paddle down the current.  He was considered as a spy by my men,
and I was confirmed in that opinion, when I saw a wooden canoe drifting
with the stream close in to the other shore, where it was more than
probable that some of the natives might be concealed.  It might,
therefore, have been an useless enterprise, or perhaps fatal to the
future success of our undertaking, if we had pursued these people, as
they might, through fear have employed their arms against us, and
provoked us to retaliate.</p>

<p>The old man informed me, that some of the natives whom I had seen here
were gone up the river, and those whom I saw below had left their late
station to gather a root in the plains, which, when dried, forms a
considerable article in their winter stock of provisions.  He had a
woman, he said, with him, who used to see us walking along the small
adjoining river, but when he called her he received no answer, so that
she had probably fled to join her people.  He informed me, also, that he
expected a considerable number of his tribe to come on the upper part of
the river to catch fish for their present support, and to cure them for
their winter store; among whom he had a son and two brothers.</p>

<p>In consequence of these communications, I deemed it altogether
unnecessary to lose any more time at this place, and I informed the old
man that he must accompany me for the purpose of introducing us to his
friends and relations, and that if we met with his son or brothers, I
depended upon him to persuade them, or some of their party, to attend us
as guides in our meditated expedition.  He expressed his wishes to be
excused from this service, and in other circumstances we should not have
insisted on it, but, situated as we were, we could not yield to his
request.</p>

<p>At seven in the morning we left this place, which I named Deserter's
River or Creek.  Our blind guide was, however, so averse to continuing
with us, that I was under the very disagreeable necessity of ordering
the men to carry him into the canoe; and this was the first act during
my voyage, that had the semblance of violent dealing.  He continued to
speak in a very loud tone, while he remained, according to his
conjecture, near enough to the camp to be heard, but in a language that
our interpreters did not understand.  On asking him what he said, and
why he did not speak in a language known to us, he replied, that the
woman understood him better in that which he spoke, and he requested
her, if she heard him, to come for him to the carrying-place, where he
expected we should leave him.</p>

<p>At length our canoe was become so leaky, that it was absolutely unfit
for service; and it was the unremitting employment of one person to keep
her clear of water: we, therefore, inquired of the old man where we
could conveniently obtain the articles necessary to build a new one; and
we understood from him that, at some distance up the river, we should
find plenty of bark and cedar.</p>

<p>At ten, being at the foot of a rapid, we saw a small canoe coming down
with two men in it.  We thought it would be impossible for them to
escape, and therefore struck off from the shore with a design to
intercept them, directing the old man at the same time to address them;
but they no sooner perceived us, than they steered into the strength of
the current, where I thought that they must inevitably perish; but their
attention appeared to be engrossed by the situation of their canoe, and
they escaped without making us the least reply.</p>

<p>About three in the afternoon we perceived a lodge at the entrance of a
considerable river on the right, as well as the tracks of people in the
mud at the mouth of a small river on the left.  As they appeared to be
fresh, we landed, and endeavoured to trace them, but without success.
We then crossed over to the lodge, which was deserted, but all the usual
furniture of such buildings remained untouched.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole of this day the men had been in a state of extreme
ill-humour, and as they did not choose openly to vent it upon me, they
disputed and quarrelled among themselves.  About sun-set the canoe
struck upon the stump of a tree, which broke a large hole in her bottom;
a circumstance that gave them an opportunity to let loose their
discontents without reserve.  I left them as soon as we had landed, and
ascended an elevated bank, in a state of mind which I scarce wish to
recollect, and shall not attempt to describe.  At this place there was a
subterraneous house, where I determined to pass the night.  The water
had risen since we had passed down, and it was with the utmost exertion
that we came up several points in the course of the day.</p>

<p>We embarked at half past four, with very favourable weather, and at
eight we landed, where there was an appearance of our being able to
procure bark; we, however, obtained but a small quantity.  At twelve we
went on shore again, and collected as much as was necessary for our
purpose.  It now remained for us to fix on a proper place for building
another canoe, as it was impossible to proceed with our old one, which
was become an absolute wreck.  At five in the afternoon we came to a
spot well adapted to the business in which we were about to engage.  It
was on a small island not much encumbered with wood, though there was
plenty of the spruce kind on the opposite land, which was only divided
from us by a small channel.  We now landed, but before the canoe was
unloaded, and the tent pitched, a violent thunder-storm came on,
accompanied with rain, which did not subside till the night had closed
in upon us.  Two of our men who had been in the woods for axe-handles,
saw a deer, and one of them shot at it, but unluckily missed his aim.  A
net was also prepared and set in the eddy at the end of the island.</p>

<h4><a name="chapter8" href="#toc_chapter8"> CHAPTER VIII.</a></h4>

<p class="noindent">JUNE, 1793.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friday, 28.</i>&mdash;At a very early hour of the morning every man was
employed in making preparations for building another canoe, and
different parties went in search of wood, watape, and gum.  At two in
the afternoon they all returned successful, except the collectors of
gum, and of that article it was feared we should not obtain here a
sufficient supply for our immediate wants.  After a necessary portion of
time allotted for refreshment, each began his respective work.  I had an
altitude at noon, which made us in 53. 2.  32. North latitude.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Saturday, 29.</i>&mdash;The weather continued to be fine.  At five o'clock we
renewed our labour, and the canoe was got in a state of considerable
forwardness.  The conductor of the work, though a good man, was
remarkable for the tardiness of his operations, whatever they might be,
and more disposed to eat than to be active; I therefore took this
opportunity of unfolding my sentiments to him, and thereby discovering
to all around me the real state of my mind, and the resolutions I had
formed for my future conduct.  After reproaching him for his general
inactivity, but particularly on the present occasion, when our time was
so precious, I mentioned the apparent want of economy, both of himself
and his companions, in the article of provisions.  I informed him that I
was not altogether a stranger to their late conversations, from whence I
drew the conclusion that they wished to put an end to the voyage.  If
that were so, I expressed my wish that they would be explicit, and tell
me at once of their determination to follow me no longer.  I concluded,
however, by assuring him, that whatever plan they had meditated to
pursue, it was my fixed and unalterable determination to proceed, in
spite of every difficulty that might oppose, or danger that should
threaten me.  The man was very much mortified at my addressing this
remonstrance particularly to him; and replied that he did not deserve my
displeasure more than the rest of them.  My object being answered, the
conversation dropped, and the work went on.</p>

<p>About two in the afternoon one of the men perceived a canoe with two
natives in it, coming along the inside of the island, but the water
being shallow, it turned back, and we imagined that on perceiving us
they had taken the alarm; but we were agreeably surprised on seeing them
come up the outside of the island, when we recognised our guide, and one
of the natives whom we had already seen; The former began immediately to
apologize for his conduct, and assured me that since he had left me, his
whole time had been employed in searching after his family, who had been
seized with the general panic, that had been occasioned by the false
reports of the people who had first fled from us.  He said it was
generally apprehended by the natives, that we had been unfriendly to
their relations above, who were expected upon the river in great numbers
at this time: and that many of the Atnah or Chin nation, had come up the
river to where we had been, in the hope of seeing us, and were very much
displeased with him and his friends for having neglected to give them an
early notice of our arrival there.  He added, that the two men whom we
had seen yesterday, or the day before, were just returned from their
rendezvous, with the natives of the sea coast, and had brought a message
from his brother-in-law, that he had a new axe for him, and not to
forget to bring a moose-skin dressed in exchange, which he actually had
in his canoe.  He expected to meet him, he said, at the other end of the
carrying-place.</p>

<p>This was as pleasing intelligence as we had reason to expect, and it is
almost superfluous to observe that we stood in great need of it.  I had
a meridian altitude, which gave 53. 3. 7. North latitude.  I also took
time in the fore and afternoon, that gave a mean of 1. 37. 42.
Achrometer slow apparent time, which, with an observed immersion of
Jupiter's first satellite, made our longitude 122. 48. West of
Greenwich.</p>

<p>The blind old man gave a very favourable account of us to his friends,
and they all three were very merry together during the whole of the
afternoon.  That our guide, however, might not escape from us during the
night, I determined to set a watch upon him.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sunday, 30.</i>&mdash;Our strangers conducted themselves with great good
humour throughout the day.  According to their information, we should
find their friends above and below the carrying-place.  They mentioned,
also, that some of them were not of their tribe, but are allied to the
people of the sea coast, who trade with the white men.  I had a meridian
altitude, that gave 53. 3. 17. North latitude.</p>

<br><p>JULY. <i>Monday, 1.</i>&mdash;Last night I had the first watch, when one of my
Indians proposed to sit up with me, as he understood, from the old man's
conversation, that he intended, in the course of the night, to make his
escape.  Accordingly, at eleven I extinguished my light, and sat quietly
in my tent, from whence I could observe the motions of the natives.
About twelve, though the night was rather dark, I observed the old man
creeping on his hands and knees towards the water-side.  We accordingly
followed him very quietly to the canoe, and he would have gone away with
it, if he had not been interrupted in his design.  On upbraiding him for
his treacherous conduct, when he had been treated with so much kindness
by us, he denied the intention of which we accused him, and declared
that his sole object was to assuage his thirst.  At length, however, he
acknowledged the truth, and when we brought him to the fire, his
friends, who now awoke, on being informed of what had passed, reprobated
his conduct, and asked him how he could expect that the white people
would return to this country, if they experienced such ungrateful
treatment.  The guide said, for his part, he was not a woman, and would
never run away through fear.  But notwithstanding this courageous
declaration, at once I awakened Mr. Mackay, related to him what had
passed, and requested him not to indulge himself in sleep, till I should
rise.  It was seven before I awoke, and on quitting my tent I was
surprised at not seeing the guide and his companion, and my
apprehensions were increased when I observed that the canoe was removed
from its late situation.  To my inquiries after them, some of the men
very composedly answered that they were gone up the river, and had left
the old man behind them.  Mr. Mackay also told me, that while he was
busily employed on the canoe, they had got to the point before he had
observed their departure.  The interpreter now informed me that at the
dawn of day the guide had expressed his design, as soon as the sun was
up, to go and wait for us, where he might find his friends.  I hoped
this might be true; but that my people should suffer them to depart
without giving me notice, was a circumstance that awakened very painful
reflections in my breast.  The weather was clear in the forenoon.  My
observation this day gave 53. 8. 82. North latitude.</p>

<p>At five in the afternoon our vessel was completed, and ready for
service.  She proved a stronger and better boat than the old one, though
had it not been for the gum obtained from the latter, it would have been
a matter of great difficulty to have procured a sufficiency of that
article to have prevented her from leaking.  The remainder of the day
was employed by the people in cleaning and refreshing themselves, as
they had enjoyed no relaxation from their labour since we landed on this
spot.</p>

<p>The old man having manifested for various and probably very fallacious
reasons, a very great aversion to accompany us any further, it did not
appear that there was any necessity to force his inclination.  We now
put our arms in order, which was soon accomplished, as they were at all
times a general object of attention.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Tuesday, 2.</i>&mdash;It rained throughout the night, but at half past three
we were ready to embark, when I offered to conduct the old man where he
had supposed we should meet his friends, but he declined the
proposition.  I therefore directed a few pounds of pemmican to be left
with him, for his immediate support, and took leave of him and the
place, which I named Canoe Island.  During our stay there we had been
most cruelly tormented by flies, particularly the sand-fly, which I am
disposed to consider as the most tormenting insect of its size in
nature.  I was also compelled to put the people upon short allowance,
and confine them to two meals a day, a regulation peculiarly offensive
to a Canadian voyager.  One of these meals was composed of the dried
rows of fish, pounded, and boiled in water, thickened with a small
quantity of flour, and fattened with a bit of grian.  These articles,
being brought to the consistency of an hasty pudding, produced a
substantial and not unpleasant dish.  The natives are very careful of
the rows of fish, which they dry, and preserve in baskets made of bark.
Those we used were found in the huts of the first people who fled from
us.  During our abode in Canoe Island, the water sunk three
perpendicular feet.  I now gave the men a dram each, which could not but
be considered, at this time, as a very comfortable treat.  They were,
indeed, in high spirits, when they perceived the superior excellence of
the new vessel, and reflected that it was the work of their own hands.</p>

<p>[Transcriber's Note: The word 'grian' above is printed thus in this,
and other, editions.]</p>

<p>At eleven we arrived at the rapids, and the foreman, who had not
forgotten the fright he suffered on coming down it, proposed that the
canoe and lading should be carried over the mountain.  I threatened him
with taking the office of foreman on myself, and suggested the evident
change there was in the appearance of the water since we passed it,
which upon examination had sunk four feet and an half.  As the water did
not seem so strong on the West side, I determined to cross over, having
first put Mr. Mackay, and our two hunters, on shore, to try the woods
for game.  We accordingly traversed, and got up close along the rocks,
to a considerable distance, with the paddles, when we could proceed no
further without assistance from the line; and to draw it across a
perpendicular rock, for the distance of fifty fathoms, appeared to be an
insurmountable obstacle.  The general opinion was to return, and carry
on the other side; I desired, however, two of the men to take the line,
which was seventy fathoms in length, with a small roll of bark, and
endeavour to climb up the rocks, from whence they were to descend on the
other side of that which opposed our progress; they were then to fasten
the end of the line to the roll of bark, which the current would bring
to us; this being effected, they would be able to draw us up.  This was
an enterprise of difficulty and danger, but it was crowned with success;
though to get to the water's edge above, the men were obliged to let
themselves down with the line, run round a tree, from the summit of the
rock.  By a repetition of the same operation, we at length cleared the
rapid, with the additional trouble of carrying the canoe, and unloading
at two cascades.  We were not more than two hours getting up this
difficult part of the river, including the time employed in repairing an
hole which had been broken in the canoe, by the negligence of the
steersman.</p>

<p>Here we expected to meet with the natives, but there was not the least
appearance of them, except that the guide, his companion, and two
others, had apparently passed the carrying-place.  We saw several fish
leap out of the water, which appeared to be of the salmon kind.  The old
man, indeed, had informed us that this was the season when the large
fish begin to come up the river.  Our hunters returned, but had not seen
the track of any animal.  We now continued our journey; the current was
not strong, but we met with frequent impediments from the fallen trees,
which lay along the banks.  We landed at eight in the evening; and
suffered indescribable inconveniences from the flies.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Wednesday, 3.</i>&mdash;It had rained hard in the night, and there was some
small rain in the morning.  At four we entered our canoe, and at ten we
came to a small river, which answered to the description of that whose
course the natives said, they follow in their journies towards the sea
coast; we therefore put into it, and endeavoured to discover if our
guide had landed here; but there were no traces of him or of any others.
My former perplexities were now renewed.  If I passed this river, it was
probable that I might miss the natives; and I had reason to suspect that
my men would not consent to return thither.  As for attempting the
woods, without a guide, to introduce us to the first inhabitants, such a
determination would be little short of absolute madness.  At length,
after much painful reflection, I resolved to come at once to a full
explanation with my people, and I experienced a considerable relief from
this resolution.  Accordingly, after repeating the promise they had so
lately made me, on our putting back up the river, I represented to them
that this appeared to me to be the spot from which the natives took
their departure for the sea coast, and added, withal, that I was
determined to try it: for though our guide had left us, it was possible
that, while we were making the necessary preparations, he or some others
might appear, to relieve us from our present difficulties.  I now found,
to my great satisfaction, that they had not come to any fixed
determination among themselves, as some of them immediately assented to
undertake the woods with me.  Others, however, suggested that it might
be better to proceed a few leagues further up the river, in expectation
of finding our guide, or procuring another, and that after all we might
return hither.  This plan I very readily agreed to adopt, but before I
left this place, to which I gave the name of the West-Road River, I sent
some of the men into the woods, in different directions, and went some
distance up the river myself, which I found to be navigable only for
small canoes.  Two of the men found a good beaten path, leading up a
hill just behind us, which I imagined to be the great road.</p>

<p>At four in the afternoon we left this place, proceeding up the river;
and had not been upon the water more than three quarters of an hour,
when we saw two canoes coming with the stream.  No sooner did the people
in them perceive us than they landed, and we went on shore at the same
place with them.  They proved to be our guide, and six of his relations.
He was covered with a painted beaver robe, so that we scarcely knew him
in his fine habiliment.  He instantly desired us to acknowledge that he
had not disappointed us, and declared, at the same time, that it was his
constant intention to keep his word.  I accordingly gave him a jacket, a
pair of trowsers, and a handkerchief, as a reward for his honourable
conduct.  The strangers examined us with the most minute attention, and
two of them, as I was now informed, belonged to the people whom we first
saw, and who fled with so much alarm from us.  They told me, also, that
they were so terrified on that occasion, as not to approach their huts
for two days; and that when they ventured thither, they found the
greater part of their property destroyed, by the fire running in the
ground.  According to their account, they were of a different tribe,
though I found no difference in their language from that of the Nagailas
or Carriers.  They are called Nascud Denee.  Their lodges were at some
distance, on a small lake, where they take fish, and if our guide had
not gone for them there, we should not have seen a human being on the
river.  They informed me that the road by their habitation is the
shortest, and they proposed that we should take it.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Thursday, 4.</i>&mdash;At an early hour this morning, and at the suggestion
of our guide, we proceeded to the landing-place that leads to the
strangers' lodges.  Our great difficulty here was to procure a temporary
separation from our company, in order to hide some articles we could not
carry with us, and which it would have been imprudent to leave in the
power of the natives.  Accordingly Mr. Mackay, and one of our Indians
embarked with them, and soon run out of our sight.  At our first
hiding-place we left a bag of pemmican, weighing ninety pounds, two bags
of wild rice, and a gallon keg of gunpowder.  Previous to our putting
these articles in the ground, we rolled them up in oilcloth, and dressed
leather.  In the second hiding-place, and guarded with the same rollers,
we hid two bags of Indian corn, or maize, and a bale of different
articles of merchandise.  When we had completed this important object,
we proceeded till half past eight, when we landed at the entrance of a
small rivulet, where our friends were waiting for us.</p>

<p>Here it was necessary that we should leave our canoe, and whatever we
could not carry on our backs.  In the first place, therefore, we
prepared a stage, on which the canoe was placed bottom upwards, and
shaded by a covering of small trees and branches, to keep her from the
sun.  We then built an oblong hollow square, ten feet by five, of green
logs, wherein we placed every article it was necessary for us to leave
here, and covered the whole with large pieces of timber.</p>

<p>While we were eagerly employed in this necessary business, our guide and
his companions were so impatient to be gone, that we could not persuade
the former to wait till we were prepared for our departure, and we had
some difficulty in persuading another of the natives to remain, who had
undertook to conduct us where the guide had promised to wait our
arrival.</p>

<p>At noon we were in a state of preparation to enter the woods, an
undertaking of which I shall not here give any preliminary opinion, but
leave those who read it to judge for themselves.</p>

<p>We carried on our backs four bags and a half of pemmican, weighing from
eighty-five to ninety pounds each; a case with my instruments, a parcel
of goods for presents, weighing ninety pounds, and a parcel containing
ammunition of the same weight.  Each of the Canadians had a burden of
about ninety pounds, with a gun, and some ammunition.  The Indians had
about forty-five pounds weight of pemmican to carry, besides their gun,
&amp;c., with which they were very much dissatisfied, and if they had dared
would have instantly left us.  They had hitherto been very much
indulged, but the moment was now arrived, when indulgence was no longer
practicable.  My own load, and that of Mr. Mackay, consisted of
twenty-two pounds of pemmican, some rice, a little sugar, &amp;c., amounting
in the whole to about seventy pounds each, besides our arms and
ammunition.  I had also the tube of my telescope swung across my
shoulder, which was a troublesome addition to my burthen.  It was
determined that we should content ourselves with two meals a day, which
were regulated without difficulty, as our provisions did not require the
ceremony of cooking.</p>

<p>In this state of equipment we began our journey, as I have already
mentioned, about twelve at noon, the commencement of which was a steep
ascent of about a mile; it lay along a well-beaten path, but the country
through which it led was rugged and ridgy, and full of wood.  When we
were in a state of extreme heat, from the toil of our journey, the rain
came on, and continued till evening, and even when it ceased, the
underwood continued its drippings upon us.</p>

<p>About half past six we arrived at an Indian camp of three fires, where
we found our guide, and on his recommendation we determined to remain
there for the night.  The computed distance of this day's journey was
about twelve geographical miles; the course about West.</p>

<p>At sun-set, an elderly man and three other natives joined us from the
Westward.  The former bore a lance, which very much resembled a
serjeant's halberd.  He had lately received it, by way of barter, from
the natives of the Sea-Coast, who procured it from the white men.  We
should meet, he said, with many of his countrymen, who had just returned
from thence.  According to his report, it did not require more than six
days' journey, for people who are not heavily laden, to reach the
country of those with whom they bartered their skins for iron, &amp;c., and
from thence it is not quite two days' march to the sea.  They proposed
to send two young men on before us, to notify to the different tribes
that we were approaching, that they might not be surprised at our
appearance, and be disposed to afford us a friendly reception.  This was
a measure which I could not but approve, and endeavoured by some small
presents to prepossess our couriers in our favour.</p>

<p>These people live but poorly at this season, and I could procure no
provision from them, but a few small, dried fish, as I think, of the
carp kind.  They had several European articles; and one of them had a
strip of fur, which appeared to me to be of the sea otter.  He obtained
it from the natives of the coast, and exchanged it with me for some
beads and a brass cross.</p>

<p>We retired to rest in as much security as if we had been long habituated
to a confidence in our present associates: indeed, we had no
alternative; for so great were the fatigues of the day in our mode of
travelling, that we were in great need of rest at night.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friday, 5.</i>&mdash;We had no sooner laid ourselves down to rest last night,
than the natives began to sing, in a manner very different from what I
had been accustomed to hear among savages.  It was not accompanied
either with dancing, drum, or rattle; but consisted of soft plaintive
tones, and a modulation that was rather agreeable: it had somewhat the
air of church music.  As the natives had requested me not to quit them
at a very early hour in the morning, it was five before I desired that
the young men, who were to proceed with us, should depart, when they
prepared to set off: but on calling to our guide to conduct us, he said
that he did not intend to accompany us any further; as the young men
would answer our purpose as well as himself.  I knew it would be in vain
to remonstrate with him, and therefore submitted to his caprice without
a reply.  However, I thought proper to inform him, that one of my people
had lost his dag or poignard, and requested his assistance in the
recovery of it.  He asked me what I would give him to conjure it back
again; and a knife was agreed to be the price of his necromantic
exertions.  Accordingly, all the dags and knives in the place were
gathered together, and the natives formed a circle round them; the
conjurer also remaining in the middle.  When this part of the ceremony
was arranged, he began to sing, the rest joining in the chorus; and
after some time he produced the poignard, which was stuck in the ground,
and returned it to me.</p>

<p>At seven we were ready to depart; when I was surprised to hear our late
guide propose, without any solicitation on our part, to resume his
office; and he actually conducted us as far as a small lake, where we
found an encampment of three families.  The young men who had undertaken
to conduct us, were not well understood by my interpreters, who
continued to be so displeased with their journey, that they performed
this part of their duty with great reluctance.  I endeavoured to
persuade an elderly man of this encampment to accompany us to the next
tribe, but no inducement of mine could prevail on him to comply with my
wishes.  I was, therefore, obliged to content myself with the guides I
had already engaged, for whom we were obliged to wait some time, till
they had provided shoes for their journey.  I exchanged two halfpence
here, one of his present Majesty, and the other of the State of
Massachusett's Bay, coined in 1787.  They hung as ornaments in
children's ears.</p>

<p>My situation here was rendered rather unpleasant by the treatment which
my hunters received from these people.  The former, it appeared, were
considered as belonging to a tribe who inhabit the mountains, and are
the natural enemies of the latter.  We had also been told by one of the
natives, of a very stern aspect, that he had been stabbed by a relation
of theirs, and pointed to a scar as the proof of it.  I was, therefore,
very glad to proceed on my journey.</p>

<p>Our guides conducted us along the lake through thick woods, and without
any path, for about a mile and a half, when we lost sight of it.  This
piece of water is about three miles long and one broad.  We then crossed
a creek and entered upon a beaten track, through an open country,
sprinkled with cyprus trees.  At twelve the sky became black, and a
heavy gust with rain shortly followed, which continued for upwards of an
hour.  When we perceived the approaching storm, we fixed our thin light
oil-cloth to screen us from it.  On renewing our march, as the bushes
were very wet, I desired our guides, they having no burdens, to walk in
front and beat them as they went: this task they chose to decline, and
accordingly I undertook it.  Our road now lay along a lake, and across a
creek that ran into it.  The guides informed me, that this part of the
country abounds in beaver: many traps were seen along the road, which
had been set for lynxes and martens.  About a quarter of a mile from the
place where we had been stopped by the rain, the ground was covered with
hail, and as we advanced, the hailstones increased in size, some of them
being as big as musket-balls.  In this manner was the ground whitened
for upwards of two miles.  At five in the afternoon we arrived on the
banks of another lake, when it again threatened rain; and we had already
been sufficiently wetted in the course of the day, to look with
complacency towards a repetition of it: we accordingly fixed our shed,
the rain continuing with great violence through the remainder of the
day: it was therefore determined, that we should stop here for the
night.</p>

<p>In the course of the day we passed three winter huts; they consisted of
low walls, with a ridge pole, covered with the branches of the Canadian
balsam-tree. One of my men had a violent pain in his knee, and I asked
the guides to take a share of his burden, as they had nothing to carry
but their beaver robes, and bows and arrows, but they could not be made
to understand a word of my request.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Saturday, 6.</i>&mdash;At four this morning I arose from my bed, such as it
was.  As we must have been in a most unfortunate predicament, if our
guides should have deserted us in the night, by way of security, I
proposed to the youngest of them to sleep with me, and he readily
consented.  These people have no covering but their beaver garments, and
that of my companions was a nest of vermin.  I, however, spread it under
us, and having laid down upon it, we covered ourselves with my camblet
cloak.  My companion's hair being greased with fish-oil, and his body
smeared with red earth, my sense of smelling as well as that of feeling,
threatened to interrupt my rest; but these inconveniences yielded to my
fatigue, and I passed a night of sound repose.</p>

<p>I took the lead in our march, as I had done yesterday, in order to clear
the branches of the wet which continued to hang upon them.  We proceeded
with all possible expedition through a level country with but little
underwood; the larger trees were of the fir kind.  At half past eight we
fell upon the road, which we first intended to have taken from the Great
River, and must be shorter than that which we had travelled.  The
West-road river was also in sight, winding through a valley.  We had not
met with any water since our encampment of last night, and though we
were afflicted with violent thirst, the river was at such a distance
from us, and the descent to it so long and steep, that we were compelled
to be satisfied with casting our longing looks towards it.  There
appeared to be more water in the river here, than at its discharge.  The
Indian account, that it is navigable for their canoes, is, I believe,
perfectly correct.</p>

<p>Our guides now told us, that as the road was very good and well traced,
they would proceed to inform the next tribe that we were coming.  This
information was of a very unpleasant nature; as it would have been easy
for them to turn off the road at an hundred yards from us, and, when we
had passed them, to return home.  I proposed that one of them should
remain with us, while two of my people should leave their loads behind
and accompany the other to the lodges.  But they would not stay to hear
our persuasions, and were soon out of sight.</p>

<p>I now desired the Cancre to leave his burden, take a small quantity of
provision, with his arms and blanket, and follow me.  I also told my men
to come on as fast as they could, and that I would wait for them as soon
as I had formed an acquaintance with the natives of the country before
us.  We accordingly followed our guides with all the expedition in our
power, but did not overtake them till we came to a family of natives,
consisting of one man, two women, and six children, with whom we found
them.  These people betrayed no signs of fear at our appearance, and the
man willingly conversed with my interpreter, to whom he made himself
more intelligible, than our guides had been able to do.  They, however,
had informed him of the object of our journey.  He pointed out to us one
of his wives, who was a native of the sea coast, which was not a very
great distance from us.  This woman was more inclined to corpulency than
any we had yet seen, was of low stature, with an oblong face, grey eyes,
and a flattish nose.  She was decorated with ornaments of various kinds,
such as large blue beads, either pendant from her ears, encircling her
neck, or braided in her hair: she also wore bracelets of brass, copper,
and horn.  Her garments consisted of a kind of tunic, which was covered
with a robe of matted bark, fringed round the bottom with skin of the
sea otter.  None of the women whom I had seen since we crossed the
mountain wore this kind of tunic; their blankets being merely girt round
the waist.  She had learned the language of her husband's tribe, and
confirmed his account, that we were at no great distance from the sea.
They were on their way, she said, to the great river to fish.  Age
seemed to be an object of great veneration among these people, for they
carried an old woman by turns on their backs who was quite blind and
infirm from the very advanced period of her life.</p>

<p>Our people having joined us and rested themselves, I requested our
guides to proceed, when the elder of them told me that he should not go
any further, but that these people would send a boy to accompany his
brother, and I began to think myself rather fortunate, that we were not
deserted by them all.</p>

<p>About noon we parted, and in two hours we came up with two men and their
families: when we first saw them they were sitting down, as if to rest
themselves; but no sooner did they perceive us than they rose up and
seized their arms.&mdash;The boys who were behind us immediately ran
forwards and spoke to them, when they laid by their arms and received us
as friends.  They had been eating green berries and dried fish We had,
indeed, scarcely joined them, when a woman and a boy came from the river
with water, which they very hospitably gave us to drink.  The people of
this party had a very sickly appearance, which might have been the
consequence of disease, or that indolence which is so natural to them,
or of both.  One of the women had a tattooed line along the chin, of the
same length of her mouth.</p>

<p>The lads now informed me that they would go no further, but that these
men would take their places; and they parted from their families with as
little apparent concern, as if they were entire strangers to each other.
One of them was very well understood by my interpreter, and had resided
among the natives of the sea coast, whom he had left but a short time.
According to his information, we were approaching a river, which was
neither large nor long, but whose banks were inhabited; and that in the
bay which the sea forms at the mouth of it, a great wooden canoe, with
white people, arrives about the time when the leaves begin to grow; I
presume in the early part of May.</p>

<p>After we parted with the last people, we came to an uneven, hilly,
swampy country, through which our way was impeded by a considerable
number of fallen trees.  At five in the afternoon we were overtaken by a
heavy shower of rain and hail, and being at the same time very much
fatigued, we encamped for the night near a small creek.  Our course till
we came to the river, was about South-West ten miles, and then West,
twelve or fourteen miles.  I thought it prudent, by way of security, to
submit to the same inconveniences I have already described, and shared
the beaver robe of one of my guides during the night.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sunday, 7.</i>&mdash;I was so busily employed in collecting intelligence from
our conductors, that I last night forgot to wind up my timepiece, and it
was the only instance of such an act of negligence since I left Fort
Chepewyan on the 11th of last October.  At five we quitted our station,
and proceeded across two mountains, covered with spruce, poplar,
white-birch, and other trees.  We then descended into a level country,
where we found a good road, through woods of cypress.  We then came to
two small lakes, at the distance of about fourteen miles.  Course about
West.  Through them the river passes, and our road kept in a parallel
line with it on a range of elevated ground.  On observing some people
before us, our guides hastened to meet them, and, on their approach, one
of them stepped forward with an axe in his hand.  This party consisted
only of a man, two women, and the same number of children.  The eldest
of the women, who probably was the man's mother, was engaged, when we
joined them, in clearing a circular spot, of about five feet in
diameter, of the weeds that infested it; nor did our arrival interrupt
her employment, which was sacred to the memory of the dead.  The spot to
which her pious care was devoted, contained the grave of an husband, and
a son, and whenever she passed this way, she always stopped to pay this
tribute of affection.</p>

<p>As soon as we had taken our morning allowance, we set forwards, and
about three we perceived more people before us.  After some alarm we
came up with them.  They consisted of seven men, as many women, and
several children.  Here I was under the necessity of procuring another
guide, and we continued our route on the same side of the river, till
six in the evening, when we crossed it.  It was knee deep, and about an
hundred yards over.  I wished now to stop for the night, as we were all
of us very much fatigued, but our guide recommended us to proceed
onwards to a family of his friends, at a small distance from thence,
where we arrived at half past seven.  He had gone forward, and procured
us a welcome and quiet reception.  There being a net hanging to dry, I
requested the man to prepare and set it in the water, which he did with
great expedition, and then presented me with a few small dried fish.
Our course was South-West about twelve miles, part of which was an
extensive swamp, that was seldom less than knee deep.  In the course of
the afternoon we had several showers of rain: I had attempted to take an
altitude, but it was past meridian.  The water of the river before the
lodge was quite still, and expanded itself the form of a small lake.  In
many other places, indeed, it had assumed the same form.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Monday, 8.</i>&mdash;It rained throughout the night, and it was seven in the
morning before the weather would allow us to proceed.  The guide brought
me five small boiled fish, in a platter made of bark; some of them were
of the carp kind, and the rest of a species for which I am not qualified
to furnish a name.  Having dried our clothes, we set off on our march
about eight, and our guide very cheerfully continued to accompany us;
but he was not altogether so intelligible as his predecessors in our
service.  We learned from him, however, that this lake, through which
the river passes, extends to the foot of the mountain, and that he
expected to meet nine men, of a tribe which inhabits the North side of
the river.</p>

<p>In this part of our journey we were surprised with the appearance of
several regular basons, some of them furnished with water, and the
others empty; their slope from the edge to the bottom formed an angle of
about forty-five degrees, and their perpendicular depth was about twelve
feet.  Those that contained water, discovered gravel near their edges,
while the empty ones were covered with grass and herbs, among which we
discovered mustard, and mint.  There were also several places from
whence the water appears to have retired, which are covered with the
same soil and herbage.</p>

<p>We now proceeded along a very uneven country, the upper parts of which
were covered with poplars, a little under-wood, and plenty of grass: the
intervening vallies were watered with rivulets.  From these
circumstances, and the general appearance of vegetation, I could not
account for the apparent absence of animals of every kind.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Tuesday, 9.</i>&mdash;At two in the afternoon we arrived at the largest river
that we had seen, since we left our canoe, and which forced its way
between and over the huge stones that opposed its current.  Our course
was about South-South-West sixteen miles along the river, which might
here justify the title of a lake.  The road was good, and our next
course, which was West by South, brought us onward ten miles, where we
encamped, fatigued and wet, it having rained three parts of the day.
This river abounds with fish, and must fall into the great river,
further down than we had extended our voyage.</p>

<p>A heavy and continued rain fell through great part of the night, and as
we were in some measure exposed to it, time was required to dry our
clothes; so that it was half past seven in the morning before we were
ready to set out.  As we found the country so destitute of game, and
foreseeing the difficulty of procuring provisions for our return, I
thought it prudent to conceal half a bag of pemmican: having sent off
the Indians, and all my people except two, we buried it under the
fire-place, as we had done on a former occasion.  We soon overtook our
party, and continued our route along the river or lake.  About twelve I
had an altitude, but it was inaccurate from the cloudiness of the
weather.  We continued our progress till five in the afternoon, when the
water began to narrow, and in about half an hour we came to a ferry,
where we found a small raft.  At this time it began to thunder, and
torrents of rain soon followed, which terminated our journey for the
day.  Our course was about South, twenty-one miles from the lake already
mentioned.  We now discovered the tops of mountains, covered with snow,
over very high intermediate land.  We killed a whitehead and a grey
eagle, and three grey partridges; we also saw two otters in the river,
and several beaver lodges along it.  When the rain ceased, we caught a
few small fish, and repaired the raft for the service of the ensuing
day.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Wednesday, 10.</i>&mdash;At an early hour of this morning we prepared to
cross the water.  The traverse is about thirty yards, and it required
five trips to get us all over.  At a short distance below, a small river
falls in, that comes from the direction in which we were proceeding.  It
is a rapid for about three hundred yards, when it expands into a lake,
along which our road conducted us, and beneath a range of beautiful
hills, covered with verdure.  At half past eight we came to the
termination of the lake, where there were two houses that occupied a
most delightful situation, and as they contained their necessary
furniture, it seemed probable that their owners intended shortly to
return.  Near them were several graves or tombs, to which the natives
are particularly attentive, and never suffer any herbage to grow upon
them.  In about half an hour we reached a place where there were two
temporary huts, that contained thirteen men, with whom we found our
guide who had preceded us, in order to secure a good reception.  The
buildings were detached from each other, and conveniently placed for
fishing in the lake.  Their inhabitants called themselves
Sloua-cuss-Dinais, which denomination, as far as my interpreter could
explain it to me, I understood to mean Red-fish Men.  They were much
more cleanly, healthy, and agreeable in their appearance, than any of
the natives whom we had passed; nevertheless, I have no doubt that they
are the same people, from their name alone, which is of the Chepewyan
language.  My interpreters, however, understood very little of what they
said, so that I did not expect much information from them.  Some of them
said it was a journey of four days to the sea, and others were of
opinion that it was six; and there were among them who extended it to
eight; but they all uniformly declared that they had been to the coast.
They did not entertain the smallest apprehension of danger from us, and,
when we discharged our pieces, expressed no sensation but that of
astonishment, which, as may be supposed, was proportionably increased
when one of the hunters shot an eagle, at a considerable distance.  At
twelve I obtained an altitude, which made our latitude 53. 4. 32. North,
being not so far South as I expected.</p>

<p>I now went, accompanied by one of my men, an interpreter, and the guide,
to visit some huts at the distance of a mile.  On our arrival, the
inhabitants presented us with a dish of boiled trout, of a small kind.
The fish would have been excellent if it had not tasted of the kettle,
which was made of the bark of the white spruce, and of the dried grass
with which it was boiled.  Besides this kind of trout, red and white
carp and jub, are the only fish I saw as the produce of these waters.</p>

<p>These people appeared to live in a state of comparative comfort; they
take a greater share in the labour of the women, than is common among
the savage tribes, and are, as I was informed, content with one wife.
Though this circumstance may proceed rather from the difficulty of
procuring subsistence, than any habitual aversion to polygamy.</p>

<p>My present guide now informed me, that he could not proceed any further,
and I accordingly engaged two of these people to succeed him in that
office; but when they desired us to proceed on the beaten path without
them, as they could not set off till the following day, I determined to
stay that night, in order to accommodate myself to their convenience.  I
distributed some trifles among the wives and children of the men who
were to be our future guides, and returned to my people.  We came back
by a different way, and passed by two buildings, erected between four
trees, and about fifteen feet from the ground, which appeared to me to
be intended as magazines for winter provisions.  At four in the
afternoon, we proceeded with considerable expedition, by the side of the
lake, till six, when we came to the end of it: we then struck off
through a much less beaten track, and at half past seven stopped for the
night.  Our course, was about West-South-West thirteen miles, and West
six miles.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Thursday, 11.</i>&mdash;I passed a most uncomfortable night: the first part
of it I was tormented with flies, and in the latter deluged with rain.
In the morning the weather cleared, and as soon as our clothes were
dried, we proceeded through a morass.  This part of the country had been
laid waste by fire, and the fallen trees added to the pain and
perplexity of our way.  A high, rocky ridge stretched along our left.
Though the rain returned, we continued our progress till noon, when our
guide took to some trees for shelter.  We then spread our oil-cloth,
and, with some difficulty, made a fire.  About two the rain ceased, when
we continued our journey through the same kind of country which we had
hitherto passed.  At half past three we came in sight of a lake; the
land at the same time gradually rising to a range of mountains whose
tops were covered with snow.  We soon after observed two fresh tracks,
which seemed to surprise our guides, but they supposed them to have been
made by the inhabitants of the country, who were come into this part of
it to fish.  At five in the afternoon we were so wet and cold (for it
had at intervals continued to rain) that we were compelled to stop for
the night.  We passed seven rivulets and a creek in this day's journey,
As I had hitherto regulated our course by the sun, I could not form an
accurate judgment of this route, as we had not been favoured with a
sight of it during the day; but I imagine it to have been nearly in the
same direction as that of yesterday.  Our distance could not have been
less than fifteen miles.</p>

<p>Our conductors now began to complain of our mode of travelling, and
mentioned their intention of leaving us; and my interpreters, who were
equally dissatisfied, added to our perplexity by their conduct.  Besides
these circumstances, and the apprehension that the distance from the sea
might be greater than I had imagined, it became a matter of real
necessity that we should begin to diminish the consumption of our
provisions, and to subsist upon two-thirds of our allowance; a
preposition which was as unwelcome to my people, as it was necessary to
put into immediate practice.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friday, 12.</i>&mdash;At half past five this morning we proceeded on our
journey, with cloudy weather, and when we came to the end of the lake,
several tracks were visible that led to the side of the water; from
which circumstance I concluded, that some of the natives were fishing
along the banks of it.  This lake is not more than three miles long, and
about one broad.  We then passed four smaller lakes, the two first being
on our right, and those which preceded, on our left.  A small river also
flowed across our way from the right, and we passed it over a
beaver-dam.  A larger lake new appeared on our right, and the mountains
on each side of us were covered with snow.  We afterwards came to
another lake on our right, and soon reached a river, which our guides
informed us was the same that we had passed on a raft.  They said it was
navigable for canoes from the great river, except two rapids, one of
which we had seen.  At this place it was upwards of twenty yards across,
and deep water.  One of the guides swam over to fetch a raft which was
on the opposite side; and having encreased its dimensions, we crossed at
two trips, except four of the men, who preferred swimming.</p>

<p>Here our conductors renewed their menace of leaving us, and I was
obliged to give them several articles, and promise more, in order to
induce them to continue till we could procure other natives to succeed
them.  At four in the afternoon we forded the same river, and being with
the guides at some distance before the rest of the people, I sat down to
wait for them, and no sooner did they arrive, than the former set off
with so much speed, that my attempt to follow them proved unsuccessful.
One of my Indians, however, who had no load, overtook them, when they
excused themselves to him by declaring that their sole motive for
leaving us, was to prevent the people, whom they expected to find, from
shooting their arrows at us.  At seven o'clock, however, were so
fatigued, that we encamped without them; the mountains covered with snow
now appeared to be directly before us.  As we were collecting wood for
our fire, we discovered a cross road, where it appeared that people had
passed within seven or eight days.  In short, our situation was such as
to afford a just cause of alarm, and that of the people with me was of a
nature to defy immediate alleviation.  It was necessary, however, for me
to attempt it; and I rested my principles of encouragement on a
representation of our past perplexities and unexpected relief, and
endeavoured to excite in them the hope of similar good fortune.  I
stated to them, that we could not be at a great distance from the sea,
and that there were but few natives to pass, till we should arrive among
those, who being accustomed to visit the sea coast, and, having seen
white people, would be disposed to treat us with kindness.  Such was the
general tenor of the reasoning I employed on the occasion, and I was
happy to find that it was not offered in vain.</p>

<p>The weather had been cloudy till three in the afternoon, when the sun
appeared; but surrounded, as we were, with snow-clad mountains; the air
became so cold, that the violence of our exercise, was not sufficient to
produce a comfortable degree of warmth.  Our course to-day was from West
to South and at least thirty-six miles.  The land in general was very
barren and stony, and lay in ridges, with cypress trees scattered over
them.  We passed several swamps, where we saw nothing to console us but
a few tracks of deer.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Saturday, 13.</i>&mdash;The weather this morning was clear but cold, and our
scanty covering was not sufficient to protect us from the severity of
the night.  About five, after we had warmed ourselves at a large fire,
we proceeded on our dubious journey.  In about an hour we came to the
edge of a wood, when we perceived a house, situated on a green spot, and
by the side of a small river.  The smoke that issued from it informed us
that it was inhabited.  I immediately pushed forward towards this
mansion, while my people were in such a state of alarm, that they
followed me with the greatest reluctance.  On looking back, I perceived
that we were in an Indian defile, of fifty yards in length.  I, however,
was close upon the house before the inhabitants perceived us, when the
women and children uttered the most horrid shrieks, and the only man who
appeared to be with them, escaped out of a back door, which I reached in
time to prevent the women and children from following him.  The man fled
with all his speed into the wood, and I called in vain on my
interpreters to speak to him, but they were so agitated with fear as to
have lost the power of utterance.  It is impossible to describe the
distress and alarm of these poor people, who believing that they were
attacked by enemies, expected an immediate massacre, which, among
themselves, never fails to follow such an event.</p>

<p>Our prisoners consisted of three women, and seven children, which
apparently composed three families.  At length, however, by our
demeanor, and our presents, we contrived to dissipate their
apprehensions.  One of the women then informed us, that their people,
with several others had left that place three nights before, on a
trading journey to a tribe whom she called Annah, which is the name the
Chepewyans give to the Knisteneaux, at the distance of three days.  She
added also, that from the mountains before us, which were covered with
snow, the sea was visible; and accompanied her information with a
present of a couple of dried fish.  We now expressed our desire that the
man might be induced to return, and conduct us in the road to the sea.
Indeed, it was not long before he discovered himself in the wood, when
he was assured, both by the women and our interpreters, that we had no
hostile design against him; but these assurances had no effect in
quieting his apprehensions.  I then attempted to go to him alone, and
showed him a knife, beads, &amp;c., to induce him to come to me, but he, in
return, made a hostile display of his bow and arrows: and, having for
some time exhibited a variety of strange antics, again disappeared.
However, he soon presented himself in another quarter, and after a
succession of parleys between us, he engaged to come and accompany us.</p>

<p>While these negotiations were proceeding, I proposed to visit the
fishing machines, to which the women readily consented, and I found in
them twenty small fish, such as trout, carp, and jub, for which I gave
her a large knife; a present that appeared to be equally unexpected and
gratifying to her.  Another man now came towards us, from a hill,
talking aloud from the time he appeared, till he reached us.  The
purport of his speech was, that he threw himself upon our mercy and we
might kill him, if it was our pleasure but that from what he had heard,
he looked rather for our friendship than our enmity.  He was an elderly
person, of a decent appearance, and I gave him some articles to
conciliate him to us.  The first man now followed with a lad along with
him, both of whom were the sons of the old man, and, on his arrival, he
gave me several half dried fish, which I considered as a peace-offering.
After some conversation with these people, respecting the country, and
our future progress through it, we retired to rest, with sensations very
different from those with which we had risen in the morning.  The
weather had been generally cloudy throughout the day, and when the sun
was obscured, extremely cold for the season.  At noon I obtained a
meridian altitude, which gave 52. 58. 58.  North latitude.  I likewise
took time in the after-noon.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sunday, 14.</i>&mdash;This morning we had a bright sun, with an East wind.
These people examined their fishing machines, when they found in them a
great number of small fish, and we dressed as many of them as we could
eat.  Thus was our departure retarded until seven, when we proceeded on
our journey, accompanied by the man and his two sons.  As I did not want
the younger, and should be obliged to feed him, I requested of his
father to leave him, for the purpose of fishing for the women.  He
replied, that they were accustomed to fish for themselves, and that I
need not be apprehensive of their encroaching upon my provisions, as
they were used to sustain themselves in their journies on herbs, and the
inner tegument of the bark of trees, for the stripping of which he had a
thin piece of bone, then hanging by his side.  The latter is of
glutinous quality, of a clammy, sweet taste, and is generally considered
by the more interior Indians as a delicacy, rather than an article of
common food.  Our guide informed me that there is a short cut across the
mountains, but as there was no trace of a road, and it would shorten our
journey but one day, he should prefer the beaten way.</p>

<p>We accordingly proceeded along a lake, West five miles.  We then crossed
a small river, and passed through a swamp, about South-West, when we
began gradually to ascend for some time till we gained the summit of a
hill, where we had an extensive view to the South-East, from which
direction a considerable river appeared to flow, at the distance of
about three miles: it was represented to me as being navigable for
canoes.  The descent of this hill was more steep than its ascent, and
was succeeded by another, whose top, though not so elevated as the last,
afforded a view of the range of mountains, covered with snow, which,
according to the intelligence of our guide, terminates in the ocean.  We
now left a small lake on our left, then crossed a creek running out of
it, and at one in the afternoon came to a house, of the same
construction and dimensions as have already been mentioned, but the
materials were much better prepared and finished.  The timber was
squared on two sides, and the bark taken off the two others; the ridge
pole was also shaped in the same manner, extending about eight or ten
feet beyond the gable end, and supporting a shed over the door: the end
of it was carved into the similitude of a snake's head.  Several
hieroglyphics and figures of a similar workmanship, and painted with red
earth, decorated the interior of the building.  The inhabitants had left
the house but a short time, and there were several bags or bundles in
it, which I did not suffer to be disturbed.  Near it were two tombs,
surrounded in a neat manner with boards, and covered with bark.  Beside
them several poles had been erected, one of which was squared, and all
of them painted.  From each of them were suspended several rolls or
parcels of bark, and our guide gave the following account of them;
which, as far as we could judge, from our imperfect knowledge of the
language, and the incidental errors of interpretation, appeared to
involve two different modes of treating their dead; or it might be one
and the same ceremony, which we did not distinctly comprehend: at all
events, it is the practice of these people to burn the bodies of their
dead, except the larger bones, which are rolled up in bark and suspended
from poles, as I have already described.  According to the other
account, it appeared that they actually bury their dead; and when
another of the family dies, the remains of the person who was last
interred are taken from the grave and burned, has been already
mentioned; so that the members of a family are thus successively buried
and burned, to make room for each other; and one tomb proves sufficient
for a family through succeeding generations.  There is no house in this
country without a tomb in its vicinity.  Our last course extended about
ten miles.</p>

<p>We continued our journey along the lake before the house, and, crossing
a river that flowed out of it, came to a kind of bank, or weir, formed
by the natives, for the purpose of placing their fishing machines, many
of which of different sizes, were lying on the side of the river.  Our
guide placed one of them, with the certain expectation that on his
return he should find plenty of fish in it.  We proceeded nine miles
further, on a good road, West-South-West, when we came to a small lake:
we then crossed a river that ran out of it, and our guides were in
continual expectation of meeting with some of the natives.  To this
place our course was a mile and a half, in the same direction as the
last.  At nine at night we crossed a river on rafts, our last distance
being about four miles South-East, on a winding road, through a swampy
country, and along a succession of small lakes.  We were now quite
exhausted, and it was absolutely necessary for us to stop for the night.
The weather being clear throughout the day, we had no reason to complain
of the cold.  Our guides encouraged us with the hope that, in two days
of similar exertion, we should arrive among people of the other nation.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Monday, 15.</i>&mdash;At five this morning we were again in motion, and
passing along a river, we at length forded it.  This stream was not more
than knee deep, about thirty yards over, and with a stony bottom.  The
old man went onward by himself, in the hope of falling in with the
people, whom he expected to meet in the course of the day.  At eleven we
came up with him, and the natives whom he expected, consisting of five
men, and part of their families.  They received us with great kindness,
and examined us with the most minute attention.  They must, however,
have been told that we were white, as our faces no longer indicated that
distinguishing complexion.  They called themselves Neguia Dinais, and
were come in a different direction from us, but were now going the same
way, to the Anah-yoe Tesse or River, and appeared to be very much
satisfied with our having joined them.  They presented us with some fish
which they had just taken in the adjoining lake.</p>

<p>Here I expected that our guides, like their predecessors, would have
quitted us, but, on the contrary, they expressed themselves to be so
happy, in our company, and that of their friends, that they voluntarily,
and with great cheerfulness proceeded to pass another night with us.
Our new acquaintance were people of a very pleasing aspect.  The hair of
the women was tied in large loose knots over the ears, and plaited with
great neatness from the division of the head, so as to be included in
the knots.  Some of them had adorned their tresses with beads, with a
very pretty effect.  The men were clothed in leather, their hair was
nicely combed, and their complexion was fairer, or perhaps it may be
said, with more propriety, that they were more cleanly, than any of the
natives whom we had yet seen.  Their eyes, though keen and sharp, are
not of that dark colour, so generally observable in the various tribes
of Indians; they were, on the contrary, of a grey hue, with a tinge of
red.  There was one man amongst them of at least six feet four inches in
height; his manners were affable, and he had a more prepossessing
appearance than any Indian I had met with in my journey; he was about
twenty-eight years of age, and was treated with particular respect by
his party.  Every man, woman, and child carried a proportionate burden,
consisting of beaver coating, and parchment, as well as skins of the
otter, the marten, the bear, the lynx, and dressed moose-skins.  The
last they procure from the Rocky-Mountain Indians.
According to their account, the people of the sea coast prefer them to
any other article.  Several of their relations and friends, they said,
were already gone, as well provided as themselves, to barter with the
people of the coast; who barter them in their turn, except the dressed
leather, with white people, who, as they had been informed, arrive there
in large canoes.</p>

<p>Such an escort was the most fortunate circumstance that could happen in
our favour.  They told us, that as the women and children could not
travel fast, we should be three days in getting to the end of our
journey; which must be supposed to have been very agreeable infomation
to people in our exhausted condition.</p>

<p>In about half an hour after we had joined our new acquaintance, the
signal for moving onwards was given by the leader of the party, who
vociferated, the words Huy, Huy, when his people joined him and
continued a clamorous conversation.  We passed along a winding road,
over hills, and through swampy vallies, from South to West.  We then
crossed a deep, narrow river, which discharges itself into a lake, on
whose side we stopped at five in the afternoon, for the night, though we
had reposed several times since twelve at noon; so that our mode of
travelling had undergone a very agreeable change.  I compute the
distance of this day's journey at about twenty miles.  In the middle of
the day the weather was clear and sultry.</p>

<p>We all sat down on a very pleasant green spot, and were no sooner
seated, than our guide and one of the party prepared to engage in play.
They had each a bundle of about fifty small sticks, neatly polished, of
the size of a quill, and five inches long: a certain number of these
sticks had red lines round them; and as many of these as one of the
players might find convenient were curiously rolled up in dry grass, and
according to the judgment of his antagonist respecting their number and
marks, he lost or won.  Our friend was apparently the loser, as he
parted with his bow and arrows, and several articles which I had given
him.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Tuesday, 16.</i>&mdash;The weather of this morning was the same as yesterday;
but our fellow-travellers were in no hurry to proceed, and I was under
the necessity of pressing them into greater expedition, by representing
the almost exhausted state of our provisions.  They, however, assured
us, that after the next night's sleep we should arrive at the river
where they were going and that we should there get fish in great
abundance.  My young men, from an act of imprudence, deprived themselves
last night of that rest which was so necessary to them.  One of the
strangers asking them several questions respecting us, and concerning
their own country, one of them gave such answers as were not credited by
the audience; whereupon he demanded, in a very angry tone, if they
thought he was disposed to tell lies, like the Rocky Mountain Indians;
and one of that tribe happening to be of the party, a quarrel ensued,
which might have been attended with the most serious consequences, if it
had not been fortunately prevented by the interference of those who were
not interested in the dispute.</p>

<p>Though our stock of provisions was getting so low, I determined,
nevertheless, to hide about twenty pounds of pemmican, by way of
providing against our return.  I therefore left two of the men behind,
with directions to bury it, as usual, under the place where we had made
our fire.</p>

<p>Our course was about West-South-West by the side of the lake, and in
about two miles we came to the end of it.  Here was a general halt, when
my men overtook us.  I was now informed, that some people of another
tribe were sent for, who wished very much to see us, two of whom would
accompany us over the mountains; that, as for themselves, they had
changed their mind, and intended to follow a small river which issued
out of the lake, and went in a direction very different from the line of
our journey.  This was a disappointment, which, though not uncommon to
us, might have been followed by considerable inconveniences.  It was my
wish to continue with them whatever way they went; but neither my
promises or entreaties would avail; these people were not to be turned
from their purpose; and when I represented the low state of our
provisions, one of them answered, that if we would stay with them all
night, he would boil a kettle of fish-roes for us.  Accordingly, without
receiving any answer, he began to make preparation to fulfil his
engagement.  He took the roes out of a bag, and having bruised them
between two stones, put them in water to soak.  His wife then took an
handful of dry grass in her hand, with which she squeezed them through
her fingers; in the mean time her husband was employed in gathering wood
to make a fire, for the purpose of heating stones.  When she had
finished her operation, she filled a water kettle nearly full of water,
and poured the roes into it.  When the stones were sufficiently heated,
some of them were put into the kettle, and others were thrown in from
time to time, till the water was in a state of boiling; the woman also
continued stirring the contents of the kettle, till they were brought to
a thick consistency; the stones were then taken out, and the whole was
seasoned with about a pint of strong rancid oil.  The smell of this
curious dish was sufficient to sicken me without tasting it, but the
hunger of my people surmounted the nauseous meal.  When unadulterated by
the stinking oil, these boiled roes are not unpalatable food.</p>

<p>In the mean time four of the people who had been expected, arrived, and,
according to the account given of them, were of two tribes whom I had
not yet known.  After some conversation, they proposed, that I should
continue my route by their houses; but the old guide, who was now
preparing to leave us, informed me that it would lengthen my journey;
and by his advice I proposed to them to conduct us along the road which
had already been marked out to us.  This they undertook without the
least hesitation; and, at the same time, pointed out to me the pass in
the mountain, bearing South by East by compass.  Here I had a meridian
altitude, and took time.</p>

<p>At four in the afternoon we parted with our late fellow-travellers in a
very friendly manner, and immediately forded the river.  The wild
parsnip, which luxuriates on the borders of the lakes and rivers, is a
favourite food of the natives: they roast the tops of this plant, in
their tender state, over the fire, and taking off the outer rind, they
are then a very palatable food.</p>

<p>We now entered the woods, and some time after arrived on the banks of
another river that flowed from the mountain, which we also forded.  The
country soon after we left the river was swampy; and the fire having
passed through it, the number of trees, which had fallen, added to the
toil of our journey.  In a short time we began to ascend, and continued
ascending till nine at night.  We walked upwards of fourteen miles,
according to my computation, in the course of the day, though the strait
line of distance might not be more than ten.  Notwithstanding that we
were surrounded by mountains covered with snow, we were very much
tormented with musquitoes.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Wednesday, 17.</i>&mdash;Before the sun rose, our guides summoned us to
proceed, when we descended into a beautiful valley, watered by a small
river.  At eight we came to the termination of it, where we saw a great
number of moles, and began again to ascend.  We now perceived many
ground-hogs, and heard them whistle in every direction.  The Indians
went in pursuit of them, and soon joined us with a female and her
litter, almost grown to their full size.  They stripped off their skins,
and gave the carcases to my people.  They also pulled up a root, which
appeared like a bunch of white berries of the size of a pea; its shape
was that of a fig, while it had the colour and taste of a potatoe.</p>

<p>We now gained the summit of the mountain, and found ourselves surrounded
by snow.  But this circumstance is caused rather by the quantity of snow
drifted in the pass, than the real height of the spot, as the
surrounding mountains rise to a much higher degree of elevation.  The
snow had become so compact that our feet hardly made a perceptible
impression on it.  We observed, however, the tracks of an herd of small
deer which must have passed a short time before us, and the Indians and
my hunters went immediately in pursuit of them.  Our way was now nearly
level, without the least snow, and not a tree to be seen in any part of
it.  The grass is very short, and the soil a reddish clay, intermixed
with small stones.  The face of the hills, where they are not enlivened
with verdure, appears, at a distance, as if fire had passed over them.
It now began to hail, snow, and rain, nor could we find any shelter but
the leeward side of an huge rock.  The wind also rose into a tempest,
and the weather was as distressing as any I had ever experienced.  After
an absence of an hour and a half, our hunters brought a small doe of the
rein-deer species, which was all they had killed, though they fired
twelve shots at a large herd of them.  Their ill success they attributed
to the weather.  I proposed to leave half of the venison in the snow,
but the men preferred carrying it, though their strength was very much
exhausted.  We had been so long shivering with cold in this situation
that we were glad to renew our march.  Here and there were scattered a
few crow-berry bushes and stinted willows; the former of which had not
yet blossomed.</p>

<p>Before us appeared a stupendous mountain, whose snow-clad summit was
lost in the clouds; between it and our immediate course, flowed the
river to which we were going.  The Indians informed us that it was at no
great distance.  As soon as we could gather a sufficient quantity of
wood, we stopped to dress some of our venison; and it is almost
superfluous to add, that we made an heartier meal than we had done for
many a day before.  To the comfort which I have just mentioned, I added
that of taking off my beard, as well as changing my linen, and my people
followed the humanising example.  We then set forwards, and came to a
large pond, on whose bank we found a tomb, but lately made, with a pole,
as usual, erected beside it, on which two figures of birds were painted,
and by them the guides distinguished the tribe to which the deceased
person belonged.  One of them, very unceremoniously, opened the bark and
shewed us the bones which it contained, while the other threw down the
pole, and having possessed himself of the feathers that were tied to it,
fixed them on his own head.  I therefore conjectured, that these funeral
memorials belonged to an individual of a tribe at enmity with them.</p>

<p>We continued our route with a considerable degree of expedition, and as
we proceeded the mountains appeared to withdraw from us.  The country
between them soon opened to our view, which apparently added to their
awful elevation.  We continued to descend till we came to the brink of a
precipice, from whence our guides discovered the river to us, and a
village on its banks.  This precipice, or rather succession of
precipices, is covered with large timber, which consists of the pine,
the spruce, the hemlock, the birch, and other trees.  Our conductors
informed us, that it abounded in animals, which, from their description,
must be wild goats.  In about two hours we arrived at the bottom, where
there is a conflux of two rivers, that issue from the mountains.  We
crossed the one which was to the left.  They are both very rapid, and
continue so till they unite their currents, forming a stream of about
twelve yards in breadth.  Here the timber was also very large; but I
could not learn from our conductors why the most considerable hemlock
trees were stripped of their bark to the tops of them.  I concluded,
indeed, at that time that the inhabitants tanned their leather with it.
Here were also the largest and loftiest elder and cedar trees that I had
ever seen.  We were now sensible of an entire change in the climate, and
the berries were quite ripe.</p>

<p>The sun was about to set, when our conductors left us to follow them as
well as we could.  We were prevented, however, from going far astray,
for we were hemmed in on both sides and behind by such a barrier as
nature never before presented to my view.  Our guides had the precaution
to mark the road for us, by breaking the branches of trees as they
passed.  This small river must, at certain seasons, rise to an uncommon
height and strength of current most probably on the melting of the snow;
as we saw a large quantity of drift wood lying twelve feet above the
immediate level of the river.  This circumstance impeded our progress,
and the protruding rocks frequently forced us to pass through the water.
It was now dark, without the least appearance of houses, though it would
be impossible to have seen them, if there had been any, at the distance
of twenty yards, from the thickness of the woods.  My men were anxious
to stop for the night; indeed the fatigue they had suffered justified
the proposal, and I left them to their choice; but as the anxiety of my
mind impelled me forwards, they continued to follow me, till I found
myself at the edge of the woods; and, notwithstanding the remonstrances
that were made, I proceeded, feeling rather than seeing my way, till I
arrived at a house, and soon discovered several fires, in small huts,
with people busily employed in cooking their fish.  I walked into one of
them without the least ceremony, threw down my burden, and, after
shaking hands with some of the people, sat down upon it.  They received
me without the least appearance of surprize, but soon made signs for me
to go up to the large house, which was erected, on upright posts, at
some distance from the ground.  A broad piece of timber with steps cut
in it, led to the scaffolding even with the floor, and by this curious
kind of ladder I entered the house at one end; and having passed three
fires, at equal distances in the middle of the building, I was received
by several people, sitting upon a very wide board, at the upper end of
it.  I shook hands with them, and seated myself beside a man, the
dignity of whose countenance induced me to give him that preference.  I
soon discovered one of my guides seated a little above me, with a neat
mat spread before him, which I supposed to be the place of honour, and
appropriated to strangers.</p>

<p>In a short time my people arrived, and placed themselves near me, when
the man, by whom I sat, immediately rose, and fetched, from behind a
plank of about four feet wide, a quantity of roasted salmon.  He then
directed a mat to be placed before me and Mr. Mackay, who was now
sitting by me.  When this ceremony was performed, he brought a salmon
for each of us, and half an one to each of my men.  The same plank also
served as a screen for the beds, whither the women and children were
already retired; but whether that circumstances took place on our
arrival, or was the natural consequence of the late hour of the night, I
did not discover.  The signs of our protector seemed to denote that we
might sleep in the house, but as we did not understand him with a
sufficient degree of certainty, I thought it prudent, from the fear of
giving offence, to order the men to make a fire without, that we might
sleep by it.  When he observed our design, he placed boards for us, that
we might not take our repose on the bare ground, and ordered a fire to
be prepared for us.  We had not been long seated round it, when we
received a large dish of salmon roes, pounded fine and beat up with
water, so as to have the appearance of a cream.  Nor was it without some
kind of seasoning that gave it a bitter taste.  Another dish soon
followed, the principal article of which was also salmon roes, with a
large proportion of gooseberries, and an herb that appeared to be
sorrel.  Its acidity rendered it more agreeable to my taste than the
former preparation.  Having been regaled with these delicacies, for such
they were considered by that hospitable spirit which provided them, we
laid ourselves down to rest, with no other canopy than the sky; but I
never enjoyed a more sound and refreshing rest, though I had a board for
my bed, and a billet for my pillow.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Thursday, 18.</i>&mdash;At five this morning I awoke, and found that the
natives had lighted a fire for us, and were sitting by it.  My
hospitable friend immediately brought me some berries and roasted
salmon, and his companions soon followed his example.  The former, which
consisted among many others, of gooseberries, hurtleberries, and
raspberries, were of the finest I ever saw or tasted, of their
respective kinds.  They also brought the dried roes of fish to eat with
the berries.</p>

<p>Salmon is so abundant in this river, that these people
have a constant and plentiful supply of that excellent fish.  To take
them with more facility, they had, with great labour, formed an
embankment or weir across the river, for the purpose of placing their
fishing machines, which they disposed both above and below it.  I
expressed my wish to visit this extraordinary work, but these people are
so superstitious, that they would not allow me a nearer examination than
I could obtain by viewing it from the bank.  The river is about fifty
yards in breadth, and by observing a man fish with a dipping net, I
judged it to be about ten feet deep at the foot of the fall.  The weir
is a work of great labour, and contrived with considerable ingenuity.
It was near four feet above the level of the water, at the time I saw
it, and nearly the height of the bank on which I stood to examine it.
The stream is stopped nearly two-thirds by it.  It is constructed by
fixing small trees in the bed of the river, in a slanting position
(which could be practicable only when the water is much lower than when
I saw it) with the thick part downwards; over these is laid a bed of
gravel, on which is placed a range of lesser trees, and so on
alternately till the work is brought to its proper height.  Beneath it
the machines are placed, into which the salmon fall when they attempt to
leap over.  On either side there is a large frame of timber-work, six
feet above the level of the upper water, in which passages are left for
the salmon leading directly into the machines, which are taken up at
pleasure.  At the foot of the fall dipping nets are also successfully
employed.</p>

<p>The water of this river is of the colour of asses' milk,
which I attributed in part to the limestone that in many places forms
the bed of the river, but principally to the rivulets which fall from
mountains of the same material.</p>

<p>These people indulge an extreme superstition respecting their fish, as
it is apparently their only animal food.  Flesh they never taste, and
one of their dogs having picked and swallowed part of a bone which we
had left, was beaten by his master till he disgorged it.  One of my
people also having thrown a bone of the deer into the river, a native,
who had observed the circumstance, immediately dived and brought it up,
and, having consigned it to the fire, instantly proceeded to wash his
polluted hands.</p>

<p>As we were still at some distance from the sea, I made application to my
friend to procure us a canoe or two, with people to conduct us thither.
After he had made various excuses, I at length comprehended that his
only objection was to the embarking venison in a canoe on their river,
as the fish would instantly smell it and abandon them, so that he, his
friends, and relations, must starve.  I soon eased his apprehensions on
that point, and desired to know what I must do with the venison that
remained, when he told me to give it to one of the strangers whom he
pointed out to me, as being of a tribe that eat flesh.  I now requested
him to furnish me with some fresh salmon in its raw state; but, instead
of complying with my wish, he brought me a couple of them roasted,
observing at the same time, that the current was very strong, and would
bring us to the next village, where our wants would be abundantly
supplied, In short, he requested that we would make haste to depart.
This was rather unexpected after so much kindness and hospitality, but
our ignorance of the language prevented us from being able to discover
the cause.</p>

<p>At eight this morning, fifteen men armed, the friends and relations of
these people, arrived by land, in consequence of notice sent them in the
night, immediately after the appearance of our guides.  They are more
corpulent and of a better appearance than the inhabitants of the
interior.  Their language totally different from any I had heard; the
Atnah or Chin tribe, as far as I can judge from the very little I saw of
that people, bear the nearest resemblance to them.  They appear to be of
a quiet and peaceable character, and never make any hostile incursions
into the lands of their neighbours.</p>

<p>Their dress consists of a single
robe tied over the shoulders, falling down behind, to the heels, and
before, a little below the knees, with a deep fringe round the bottom.
It is generally made of the bark of the cedar tree, which they prepare
as fine as hemp; though some of these garments are interwoven with
strips of the sea-otter skin, which give them the appearance of a fur on
one side.  Others have stripes of red and yellow threads fancifully
introduced toward the borders, which have a very agreeable effect.  The
men have no other covering than that which I have described, and they
unceremoniously lay it aside when they find it convenient.  In addition
to this robe, the women wear a close fringe hanging down before them
about two feet in length, and half as wide.  When they sit down they
draw this between their thighs.  They wear their hair so short, that it
requires: little care or combing.  The men have their's in plaits, and
being smeared with oil and red earth, instead of a comb they have a
small stick hanging by a string from one of the locks, which they employ
to alleviate any itching or irritation in the head.  The colour of the
eye is grey with a tinge of red.  They have all high cheek-bones, but
the women are more remarkable for that feature than the men.  Their
houses, arms, and utensils I shall describe hereafter.</p>

<p>I presented my friend with several articles, and also distributed some
among others of the natives who had been attentive to us.  One of my
guides had been very serviceable in procuring canoes for us to proceed
on our expedition; he appeared also to be very desirous of giving these
people a favourable impression of us; and I was very much concerned that
he should leave me as he did, without giving me the least notice of his
departure, or receiving the presents which I had prepared for him, and he
so well deserved.  At noon I had an observation which gave 52. 28. 11.
North latitude.</p>

<p class="noindent">JULY, 1793.</p>


<p>At one in the afternoon we embarked, with our small baggage, in two
canoes, accompanied by seven of the natives, The stream was rapid, and
ran upwards of six miles an hour.  We came to a weir, such as I have
already described, where the natives landed us, and shot over it without
taking a drop of water.  They then received us on board again, and we
continued our voyage, passing many canoes on the river, some with people
in them, and others empty.  We proceeded at a very great rate for about
two hours and a half, when we were informed that we must land, as the
village was only at a short distance.  I had imagined that the Canadians
who accompanied me were the most expert canoe-men in the world, but they
are very inferior to these people, as they themselves acknowledged, in
conducting those vessels.</p>

<p>Some of the Indians ran before us, to announce our approach, when we
took our bundles and followed.  We had walked along a well-beaten path,
through a kind of coppice, when we were informed of the arrival of our
couriers at the houses, by the loud and confused talking of the
inhabitants.  As we approached the edge of the wood, and were almost in
sight of the houses, the Indians who were before me made signs for me to
take the lead, and that they would follow.  The noise and confusion of
the natives now seemed to encrease, and when we came in sight of the
village, we saw them running from house to house, some armed with bows
and arrows, others with spears, and many with axes, as if in a state of
great alarm, This very unpleasant and unexpected circumstance, I
attributed to our sudden arrival, and the very short notice of it which
had been given them.  At all events, I had but one line of conduct to
pursue, which was to walk resolutely up to them, without manifesting any
signs of apprehension at their hostile appearance.  This resolution
produced the desired effect, for as we approached the houses, the
greater part of the people laid down their weapons, and came forward to
meet us.  I was, however, soon obliged to stop from the number of them
that surrounded me.  I shook hands, as usual with such as were nearest
to me, when an elderly man broke through the crowd, and took me in his
arms; another then came, who turned him away without the least ceremony,
and paid me the same compliment.  The latter was followed by a young
man, whom I understood to be his son.  These embraces, which at first
rather surprised me, I soon found to be marks of regard and friendship.
The crowd pressed with so much violence and contention to get a view of
us, that we could not move in any direction.  An opening was at length
made to allow a person to approach me, whom the old man made me
understand was another of his sons.  I instantly stepped forward to meet
him, and presented my hand, whereupon he broke the string of a very
handsome robe of sea otter skin, which he had on, and covered me with
it.  This was as flattering a reception as I could possibly receive,
especially as I considered him to be the eldest son of the chief.
Indeed, it appeared to me that we had been detained here for the purpose
of giving him time to bring the robe with which he had presented me.</p>

<p>The chief now made signs for us to follow him, and he conducted us
through a narrow coppice, for several hundred yards, till we came to a
house built on the ground, which was of larger dimensions, and formed of
better materials than any I had hitherto seen; it was his residence.  We
were no sooner arrived there, than he directed mats to be spread before
it, on which we were told to take our seats, when the men of the
village, who came to indulge their curiosity, were ordered to keep
behind us.  In our front other mats were placed, where the chief and his
counsellors took their seats.  In the intervening space, mats, which
were very clean, and of a much neater workmanship than those on which we
sat, were also spread, and a small roasted salmon placed before each of
us.  When we had satisfied ourselves with the fish, one of the people
who came with us from the last village approached, with a kind of ladle
in one hand, containing oil, and in the other something that resembled
the inner rind of the cocoa-nut, but of a lighter colour, this he dipped
in the oil, and, having eat it, indicated by his gestures how palatable
he thought it.  He then presented me with a small piece of it, which I
chose to taste in its dry state, though the oil was free from any
unpleasant smell.  A square cake of this was next produced, when a man
took it to the water near the house, and having thoroughly soaked it, he
returned, and, after he had pulled it to pieces like oakum, put it into
a well-made trough, about three feet long, nine inches wide, and five
deep; he then plentifully sprinkled it with salmon oil, and manifested
by his own example that we were to eat of it.  I just tasted it, and
found the oil perfectly sweet, without which the other ingredient would
have been very insipid.  The chief partook of it with great avidity,
after it had received an additional quantity of oil.  This dish is
considered by these people as a great delicacy, and on examination, I
discovered it to consist of the inner rind of the hemlock tree, taken
off early in summer, and put into a frame, which shapes it into cakes of
fifteen inches long, ten broad, and half an inch thick; and in this form
I should suppose it may be preserved for a great length of time.  This
discovery satisfied me respecting the many hemlock trees which I had
observed stripped of their bark.</p>

<p>In this situation we remained for upwards of three hours, and not one of
the curious natives left us during all that time, except a party of ten
or twelve of them, whom the chief ordered to go and catch fish, which
they did in great abundance, with dipping nets, at the foot of the Weir.</p>

<p>At length we were relieved from the gazing crowd, and got a lodge
erected, and covered in for our reception during the night.  I now
presented the young chief with a blanket, in return for the robe with
which he had favoured me, and several other articles, that appeared to
be very gratifying to him.  I also presented some to his father, and
amongst them was a pair of scissors, whose use I explained to him, for
clipping his beard, which was of great length; and to that purpose he
immediately applied them.  My distribution of similar articles was also
extended to others, who had been attentive to us.  The communication,
however, between us was awkward and inconvenient, for it was carried on
entirely by signs, as there was not a person with me who was qualified
for the office of an interpreter.</p>

<p>We were all of us very desirous to get some fresh salmon, that we might
dress them in our own way, but could not by any means obtain that
gratification, though there were thousands of that fish strung on cords,
which were fastened to stakes in the river.  They were even averse to
our approaching the spot where they clean and prepare them for their own
eating.  They had, indeed, taken our kettle from us, lest we should
employ it in getting water from the river; and they assigned as the
reason for this precaution, that the salmon dislike the smell of iron.
At the same time, they supplied us with wooden boxes, which were capable
of holding any fluid.  Two of the men who went to fish, in a canoe
capable of containing ten people, returned with a full lading of salmon,
that weighed from six to forty pounds, though the far greater part of
them were under twenty.  They immediately strung the whole of them, as I
have already mentioned, in the river.</p>

<p>I now made the tour of the village, which consisted of four elevated
houses, and seven built on the ground, besides a considerable number of
other buildings or sheds, which are used only as kitchens, and places
for curing their fish.  The former are constructed by fixing a certain
number of posts in the earth, on some of which are laid, and to others
are fastened, the supporters of the floor, at about twelve feet above
the surface of the ground; their length is from a hundred to a hundred
and twenty feet, and they are about forty in breadth.  Along the centre
are built three, four, or five hearths, for the two-fold purpose of
giving warmth, and dressing their fish.  The whole length of the
building on either side is divided by cedar planks, into partitions or
apartments of seven feet square, in the front of which there are boards,
about three feet wide, over which, though they are not immovably fixed,
the inmates of these recesses generally pass, when they go to rest.  The
greater part of them are intended for that purpose, and such are covered
with boards, at the height of the wall of the house, which is about
seven or eight feet, and rest upon beams that stretch across the
building.  On those also are placed the chests which contain their
provisions, utensils, and whatever they possess.  The intermediate space
is sufficient for domestic purposes.  On poles that run along the beams,
hang roasted fish, and the whole building is well covered with boards
and bark, except within a few inches of the ridge pole; where open
spaces are left on each side to let in light and emit the smoke.  At the
end of the house that fronts the river, is a narrow scaffolding, which
is also ascended by a piece of timber, with steps cut in it; and at each
corner of this erection there are openings for the inhabitants to ease
nature.  As it does not appear to be a custom among them to remove these
heaps of excremental filth, it may be supposed that the effluvia does
not annoy them.</p>

<p>The houses which rest on the ground are built of the same materials, and
on the same plan.  A sloping stage that rises to a cross piece of
timber, supported by two forks, joins also to the main building, for
those purposes which need not be repeated.</p>

<p>When we were surrounded by the natives on our arrival, I counted
sixty-five men, and several of them may be supposed to have been absent;
I cannot, therefore, calculate the inhabitants of this village at less
than two hundred souls.</p>

<p>The people who accompanied us hither, from the other village, had given
the chief a very particular account of everything they knew concerning
us: I was, therefore, requested to produce my astronomical instruments,
nor could I have any objection to afford them this satisfaction, as they
would necessarily add to our importance in their opinion.</p>

<p>Near the house of the chief I observed several oblong squares, of about
twenty feet by eight.  They were made of thick cedar boards, which were
joined with so much neatness, that I at first thought they were one
piece.  They were painted with hieroglyphics, and figures of different
animals, and with a degree of correctness that was not to be expected
from such an uncultivated people.  I could not learn the use of them,
but they appeared to be calculated for occasional acts of devotion or
sacrifice, which all these tribes perform at least twice in the year, at
the spring and fall.  I was confirmed in this opinion by a large
building in the middle of the village, which I at first took for the
half finished frame of a house.  The groundplot of it was fifty feet by
forty-five; each end is formed by four stout posts, fixed
perpendicularly in the ground.  The corner ones are plain, and support a
beam of the whole length, having three intermediate props on each side,
but of a larger size, and eight or nine feet in height.  The two centre
posts, at each end, are two feet and a half in diameter, and carved into
human figures, supporting two ridge poles on their heads, at twelve feet
from the ground.  The figures at the upper part of this square represent
two persons, with their hands upon their knees, as if they supported the
weight with pain and difficulty; the others opposite to them stand at
their ease, with their hands resting on their hips.  In the area of the
building there were the remains of several fires.  The posts, poles, and
figures, were painted red and black; but the sculpture of these people
is superior to their painting.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friday, 19.</i>&mdash;Soon after I retired to rest last night, the chief paid
me a visit to insist on my going to his bed-companion, and taking my
place himself; but, notwithstanding his repeated entreaties, I resisted
this offering of his hospitality.</p>

<p>At an early hour this morning, I was again visited by the chief, in
company with his son.  The former complained of a pain in his breast; to
relieve his suffering, I gave him a few drops of Turlington's Balsam on
a piece of sugar; and I was rather surprised to see him take it without
the least hesitation.  When he had taken my medicine, he requested me to
follow him, and conducted me to a shed, where several people were
assembled round a sick man, who was another of his sons.  They
immediately uncovered him, and showed me a violent ulcer in the small of
his back, in the foulest state that can be imagined.  One of his knees
was also afflicted in the same manner.  This unhappy man was reduced to
a skeleton, and, from his appearance, was drawing near to an end of his
pains.  They requested that I would touch him, and his father was very
urgent with me to administer medicine; but he was in such a dangerous
state, that I thought it prudent to yield no further to the
importunities than to give the sick man a few drops of Turlington's
Balsam in some water.  I therefore left them, but was soon called back
by the loud lamentations of the women, and was rather apprehensive that
some inconvenience might result from my compliance with the chief's
request.  On my return I found the native physicians busy in practising
their skill and art on the patient.  They blew on him, and then
whistled; at times they pressed their extended fingers, with all their
strength, on his stomach; they also put their forefingers doubled into
his mouth, and spouted water from their own with great violence into his
face.  To support these operations, the wretched sufferer was held up in
a sitting posture; and when they were concluded, he was laid down and
covered with a new robe made of the skins of the lynx.  I had observed
that his belly and breast were covered with scars, and I understood that
they were caused by a custom prevalent among them, of applying pieces of
lighted touch-wood to their flesh, in order to relieve pain or
demonstrate their courage.  He was now placed on a broad plank, and
carried by six men into the woods, where I was invited to accompany
them.  I could not conjecture what would be the end of this ceremony,
particularly as I saw one man carry fire, another an axe, and a third
dry wood.  I was indeed, disposed to suspect that, as it was their
custom to burn the dead, they intended to relieve the poor man from his
pain, and perform the last sad duty of surviving affection.  When they
advanced a short distance into the woods, they laid him upon a clear
spot, and kindled a fire against his back, when the physician began to
scarify the ulcer with a very blunt instrument, the cruel pain of which
operation the patient bore with incredible resolution.  The scene
afflicted me, and I left it.</p>

<p>On my return to our lodge, I observed before the door of the chief's
residence, four heaps of salmon, each of which consisted of between
three and four hundred fish.  Sixteen women were employed in cleaning
and preparing them.  They first separate the head from the body, the
former of which they boil; they then cut the latter down the back on
each side of the bone, leaving one third of the fish adhering to it, and
afterwards take out the guts.  The bone is roasted for immediate use,
and the other parts are dressed in the same manner, but with more
attention, for future provision.  While they are before the fire,
troughs are placed under them to receive the oil.  The roes are also
carefully preserved, and form a favourite article of their food.</p>

<p>After I had observed these culinary preparations, I paid a visit to the
chief, who presented me with a roasted salmon; he then opened one of his
chests, and took out of it a garment of blue cloth, decorated with brass
buttons; and another of flowered cotton, which I supposed were Spanish;
it had been trimmed with leather fringe, after the fashion of their own
cloaks.  Copper and brass are in great estimation among them, and of the
former they have great plenty: they point their arrows and spears with
it, and work it up into personal ornaments; such as collars, ear-rings,
and bracelets, which they wear on their wrists, arms, and legs.  I
presume they find it the most advantageous articles of trade with the
more inland tribes.  They also abound in iron.  I saw some of their
twisted collars of that metal which weighed upwards of twelve pounds.
It is generally beat in bars of fourteen inches in length, and one inch
three quarters wide.  The brass is in thin squares: their copper is in
larger pieces, and some of it appeared to be old stills cut up.  They
have various trinkets; but their manufactured iron consists only of
poignards and daggers.  Some of the former have very neat handles, with
a silver coin of a quarter or eighth of a dollar fixed on the end of
them.&mdash;The blades of the latter are from ten to twelve inches in
length, and about four inches broad at the top, from which they
gradually lessen to a point.</p>

<p>When I produced my instruments to take an altitude, I was desired not to
make use of them.  I could not then discover the cause of this request,
but I experienced the good effect of the apprehension, which they
occasioned, as it was very effectual in hastening my departure.  I had
applied several times to the chief to prepare canoes and people to take
me and my party to the sea, but very little attention had been paid to
my application till noon; when I was informed that a canoe was properly
equipped for my voyage, and that the young chief would accompany me.  I
now discovered that they had entertained no personal fear of the
instruments, but were apprehensive that the operation of them might
frighten the salmon from that part of the river.  The observation taken
in this village gave me 52. 25. 52. North latitude.</p>

<p>In compliance with the chief's request I desired my people to take their
bundles, and lay them down on the bank of the river.  In the mean time I
went to take the dimensions of his large canoe, in which, it was
signified to me, that about ten winters ago he went a considerable
distance toward the mid-day sun, with forty of his people, when he saw
two large vessels full of such men as myself, by whom he was kindly
received: they were, he said, the first white people he had seen.  They
were probably the ships commanded by Captain Cook.  This canoe was built
of cedar, was forty-five feet long, four feet wide, and three feet and a
half in depth.  It was painted black and decorated with white figures of
fish of different kinds.  The gunwale, fore and aft, was inlaid with
the teeth of the sea-otter.<a name="v2-c9-hl1" href="#v2-c9-hr1">[1]</a></p>

<p>When I returned to the river, the natives who were to accompany us and
my people, were already in the canoe.  The latter, however, informed me,
that one of our axes was missing.  I immediately applied to the chief,
and requested its restoration; but he would not understand me till I sat
myself down on a stone, with my arms in a state of preparation, and made
it appear to him that I should not depart till the stolen article was
restored.  The village was immediately in a state of uproar, and some
danger was apprehended from the confusion that prevailed in it.  The
axe, however, which had been hidden under the chief's canoe, was soon
returned.  Though this instrument was not, in itself, of sufficient
value to justify a dispute with these people, I apprehended that the
suffering them to keep it, after we had declared its loss, might have
occasioned the loss of every thing we carried with us, and of our lives
also.  My people were dissatisfied with me at the moment; but I thought
myself right then, and, I think now, that the circumstances in which we
were involved, justified the measure which I adopted.</p>

<p><a name="v2-c9-hr1" href="#v2-c9-hl1">[1]</a> As Captain Cook has mentioned, that the people of the sea-coast
adorned their canoes with human teeth, I was more particular in my
inquiries; the result of which was, the most satisfactory proof that he
was mistaken; but his mistake arose from the very great resemblance
there is between human teeth and those of the sea-otter.</p>

<h4><a name="chapter10" href="#toc_chapter10"> CHAPTER X.</a></h4>

<p class="noindent">JULY, 1793.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Saturday, 18.</i>&mdash;At one in the afternoon we renewed our voyage in a
large canoe with four of the natives.  We found the river almost one
continued rapid, and in half an hour we came to a house, where, however,
we did not land, though invited by the inhabitants.  In about an hour we
arrived at two houses, where we were, in some degree, obliged to go on
shore, as we were informed that the owner of them was a person of
consideration.  He indeed received and regaled us in the same manner as
at the last village; and to increase his consequence, he produced many
European articles, and amongst them were at least forty pounds weight of
old copper stills.  We made our stay as short as possible, and our host
embarked with us.  In a very short time we were carried by the rapidity
of the current to another house of very large dimensions, which was
partitioned into different apartments, and whose doors were on the side.
The inhabitants received us with great kindness; but instead of fish,
they placed a long, clean, and well made trough before us full of
berries.  In addition to those which we had already seen, there were
some black, that were larger than the hurtleberry, and of a richer
flavour; others white, which resembled the blackberry in everything but
colour.  Here we saw a woman with two pieces of copper in her under lip,
as described by Captain Cook.  I continued my usual practice of making
these people presents in return for their friendly reception and
entertainment.</p>

[Transcriber's Note: By context, the date above should read <i> Friday, 19.</i>]

<p>The navigation of the river now became more difficult, from the numerous
channels into which it was divided, without any sensible diminution in
the velocity of its current.  We soon reached another house of the
common size, where we were well received; but whether our guides had
informed them that we were not in want of anything, or that they were
deficient in inclination, or perhaps the means, of being hospitable to
us, they did not offer us any refreshment.  They were in a state of busy
preparation.  Some of the women were employed in beating and preparing
the inner rind of the cedar bark, to which they gave the appearance of
flax.  Others were spinning with a distaff and spindle.  One of them was
weaving a robe of it, intermixed with stripes of the sea-otter skin, on
a frame of adequate contrivance that was placed against the side of the
house.  The men were fishing on the river with drag-nets between two
canoes.  These nets are forced by poles to the bottom, the current
driving them before it; by which means the salmon coming up the river
are intercepted, and give notice of their being taken by the struggles
they make in the bag or sleeve of the net.  There are no weirs in this
part of the river, as I suppose, from the numerous channels into which
it is divided.  The machines, therefore, are placed along the banks, and
consequently these people are not so well supplied with fish as the
village which has been already described, nor do they appear to possess
the same industry.  The inhabitants of the last house accompanied us in
a large canoe.  They recommended us to leave ours here, as the next
village was but at a small distance from us, and the water more rapid
than that which we had passed.  They informed us also, that we were
approaching a cascade.  I directed them to shoot it, and proceeded
myself to the foot thereof, where I re-embarked, and we went on with
great velocity, till we came to a fall, where we left our canoe, and
carried our luggage along a road through a wood for some hundred yards,
when we came to a village, consisting of six very large houses, erected
on pallisades, rising twenty-five feet from the ground, which differed
in no one circumstance from those already described, but the height of
their elevation.  They contained only four men and their families.  The
rest of the inhabitants were with us and in the small houses which we
passed higher up the river.<a name="v2-c10-hl1" href="#v2-c10-hr1">[1]</a> These people do not seem to enjoy the
abundance of their neighbours, as the men who returned from fishing had
no more than five salmon; they refused to sell one of them, but gave me
one roasted of a very indifferent kind.  In the houses there were
several chests or boxes containing different articles that belonged to
the people whom we had lately passed.  If I were to judge by the heaps
of filth beneath these buildings, they must have been erected at a more
distant period than any which we had passed.  From these houses I could
perceive the termination of the river, and its discharge into a narrow
arm of the sea.</p>

<p>As it was now half past six in the evening, and the weather cloudy, I
determined to remain here for the night, and for that purpose we
possessed ourselves of one of the unoccupied houses.  The remains of our
last meal, which we brought with us, served for our supper, as we could
not procure a single fish from the natives.  The course of the river is
about West, and the distance from the great village upwards of
thirty-six miles.&mdash;There we had lost our dog, a circumstance of no
small regret to me.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Saturday, 20.</i>&mdash;We rose at a very early hour this morning, when I
proposed to the Indians to run down our canoe, or procure another at
this place.  To both these proposals they turned a deaf ear, as they
imagined that I should be satisfied with having come in sight of the
sea.  Two of them peremptorily refused to proceed; but the other two
having consented to continue with us, we obtained a larger canoe than
our former one, and though it was in a leaky state we were glad to
possess it.</p>

<p>At about eight we got out of the river, which discharges itself by
various channels into an arm of the sea.  The tide was out, and had left
a large space covered with sea-weed.  The surrounding hills were
involved in fog.  The wind was at West, which was ahead of us, and very
strong; the bay appearing to be from one to three miles in breadth.  As
we advanced along the land we saw a great number of sea-otters.  We
fired several shots at them, but without any success from the rapidity
with which they plunge under the water.  We also saw many small
porpoises or divers.  The white-headed eagle, which is common in the
interior parts; some small gulls, a dark bird which is inferior in size
to the gull, and a few small ducks, were all the birds which presented
themselves to our view.</p>

<p>At two in the afternoon the swell was so high, and the wind, which was
against us, so boisterous, that we could not proceed with our leaky
vessel, we therefore landed in a small cove on the right side of the
bay.  Opposite to us appeared another small bay, in the mouth of which
is an island, and where, according to the information of the Indians, a
river discharges itself that abounds in salmon.</p>

<p>Our young Indians now discovered a very evident disposition to leave us;
and, in the evening, one of them made his escape.  Mr. Mackay, however,
with the other, pursued and brought him back; but as it was by no means
necessary to detain him, particularly as provisions did not abound with
us, I gave him a small portion, with a pair of shoes, which were
necessary for his journey, and a silk handkerchief, telling him at the
same time, that he might go and inform his friends, that we should also
return in three nights.  He accordingly left us, and his companion, the
young chief, went with him.</p>

<p>When we landed, the tide was going out, and at a quarter past four it
was ebb, the water having fallen in that short period eleven feet and an
half.  Since we left the river, not a quarter of an hour had passed in
which we did not see porpoises and sea-otters.  Soon after ten it was
high water, and rendered it necessary that our baggage should be shifted
several times, though not till some of the things had been wetted.</p>

<p>We were now reduced to the necessity of looking out for fresh water,
with which we were plentifully supplied by the rills that ran down from
the mountains.</p>

<p>When it was dark the young chief returned to us, bearing a large
porcupine on his back.  He first cut the animal open, and having
disencumbered it of the entrails, threw them into the sea; he then
singed its skin, and boiled it in separate pieces, as our kettle was not
sufficiently capacious to contain the whole; nor did he go to rest, till
with the assistance of two of my people who happened to be awake, every
morsel of it was devoured.</p>

<p>I had flattered myself with the hope of getting a distance of the moon
and stars, but the cloudy weather continually disappointed me, and I
began to fear that I should fail in this important object; particularly
as our provisions were at a very low ebb, and we had, as yet, no reason
to expect any assistance from the natives.  Our stock was, at this time,
reduced to twenty pounds weight of pemmican, fifteen pounds of rice, and
six pounds of flour, among ten half-starved men, in a leaky vessel, and
on a barbarous coast.  
Our course from the river was about West-South-West, distance ten miles.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sunday, 21.</i>&mdash;At forty minutes past four this morning it was low
water, which made fifteen feet of perpendicular height below the
high-water mark of last night.  Mr. Mackay collected a quantity of small
muscles which we boiled.  Our people did not partake of this regale, as
they are wholly unacquainted with sea shell-fish.  Our young chief being
missing, we imagined that he had taken his flight, but, as we were
preparing to depart, he fortunately made his appearance from the woods,
where he had been to take his rest after his feast of last night.</p>

<p>At six we were upon the water, when we cleared the small bay, which we
named Porcupine Cove, and steered West-South-West for seven miles, we
then opened a channel about two miles and a half wide at
South-South-West, and had a view of ten or twelve miles into it.</p>

<p>As I could not ascertain the distance from the open sea, and being
uncertain whether we were in a bay or among inlets and channels of
islands, I confined my search to a proper place for taking an
observation.  We steered, therefore, along the land on the left,
West-North-West a mile and a half; then North-West one fourth of a mile,
and North three miles to an island the land continuing to run
North-North-West, then along the island, South-South-West half a mile,
West a mile and a half, and from thence directly across to the land on
the left, (where I had an altitude,) South-West three miles.<a name="v2-c10-hl2" href="#v2-c10-hr2">[2]</a> From
this position a channel, of which the island we left appeared to make a
check, bears North by East.</p>

<p>Under the land we met with three canoes, with fifteen men in them, and
laden with their moveables, as if proceeding to a new situation, or
returning to a former one.  They manifested no kind of mistrust or fear
of us, but entered into conversation with our young man, as I supposed,
to obtain some information concerning us.  It did not appear that they
were the same people as those we had lately seen, as they spoke the
language of our young chief, with a different accent.  They then
examined everything we had in our canoe, with an air of indifference and
disdain.  One of them in particular made me understand, with an air of
insolence, that a large canoe had lately been in this bay, with people
in her like me, and that one of them, whom he called <i>Macubah</i> had fired
on him and his friends, and that <i>Bensins</i> had struck him on the back,
with the flat part of his sword.  He also mentioned another name, the
articulation of which I could not determine.  At the same time he
illustrated these circumstances by the assistance of my gun and sword; and
I do not doubt but he well deserved the treatment which he described.
He also produced several European articles, which could not have been long
in his possession.  From his conduct and appearance, I wished very much to
be rid of him, and flattered myself that he would prosecute his voyage,
which appeared to be in an opposite direction to our course.</p>

<p>However, when I prepared to part from them, they turned their canoes
about, and persuaded my young man to leave me, which I could not
prevent.</p>

<p>We coasted along the land<a name="v2-c10-hl3" href="#v2-c10-hr3">[3]</a> at about West-South-West for six miles, and
met a canoe with two boys in it, who were dispatched to summon the
people on that part of the coast to join them.  The troublesome fellow
now forced himself into my canoe, and pointed out a narrow channel on
the opposite shore, that led to his village, and requested us to steer
towards it, which I accordingly ordered.  His importunities now became
very irksome, and he wanted to see everything we had, particularly my
instruments, concerning which he must have received information from my
young man.  He asked for my hat, my handkerchief, and in short,
everything that he saw about me.  At the same time he frequently
repeated the unpleasant intelligence that he had been shot at by people
of my colour.  At some distance from the land a channel opened to us, at
South-West by West, and pointing that way, he made me understand that
<i>Macubah</i> came there with his large canoe.  When we were in mid-channel,
I perceived some sheds, or the remains of old buildings on the shore;
and as, from that circumstance I thought it probable that some Europeans
might have been there I directed my steersman to make for that spot.
The traverse is upwards of three miles North-West.</p>

<p>We landed, and found the ruins of a village, in a situation calculated
for defence.  The place itself was overgrown with weeds, and in the
centre of the houses there was a temple, of the same form and
construction as that which I described at the large village.  We were
soon followed by ten canoes, each of which contained from three to six
men.  They informed us that we were expected at the village, where we
should see many of them.  From their general deportment I was very
apprehensive that some hostile design was meditated against us, and for
the first time I acknowledged my apprehensions to my people.  I
accordingly desired them to be very much upon their guard, and to be
prepared if any violence was offered to defend themselves to the last.</p>

<p>We had no sooner landed, than we took possession of a rock, where there
was not space for more than twice our number, and, which admitted of our
defending ourselves with advantage, in case we should be attacked.  The
people in the three first canoes, were the most troublesome, but, after
doing their utmost to irritate us, they went away.</p>

<p>They were, however, no sooner gone, than a hat, a handkerchief, and
several other articles, were missing.  The rest of our visitors
continued their pressing invitations to accompany them to their village,
but finding our resolution to decline them was not to be shaken, they,
about sun-set relieved us from all further importunities, by their
departure.</p>

<p>Another canoe, however, soon arrived, with seven stout, well-looking
men.  They brought a box, which contained a very fine sea-otter skin,
and a goat skin that was beautifully white.  For the former they
demanded my hanger, which, as may well be supposed, could not be spared
in our present situation, and they actually refused to take a yard and a
half of common broad cloth, with some other articles, for the skin,
which proves the unreflecting improvidence of our European traders.  The
goat-skin was so bulky that I did not offer to purchase it.  These men
also told me that <i>Macubah</i> had been there, and left his ship behind a
point of land in the channel, South-West from us; from whence he had
come to their village in boats, which these people represented by
imitating our manner of rowing.  When I offered them what they did not
choose to accept for the otter-skin, they shook their heads, and very
distinctly answered, "No, no." And to mark their refusal of anything we
asked from them, they emphatically employed the same British
monosyllable.  In one of the canoes which had left us, there was a seal,
that I wished to purchase, but could not persuade the natives to part
with it.  They had also a fish, which I now saw for the first time.  It
was about eighteen inches in length, of the shape and appearance of a
trout, with strong sharp teeth.  We saw great numbers of the animals
which we had taken for sea-otters, but I was new disposed to think that
a great part of them, at least, must have been seals.  The natives
having left us, we made a fire to warm ourselves, and as for supper,
there was but little of that, for our whole daily allowance did not
amount to what was sufficient for a single meal.  The weather was clear
throughout the day, which was succeeded by a fine moon-light night.  I
directed the people to keep watch by two in turn, and laid myself down
on my cloak.</p>

<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Monday, 22.</i>&mdash;This morning the weather was clear and pleasant; nor had
anything occurred to disturb us throughout the night.  One solitary
Indian, indeed, came to us with about half a pound of boiled seal's
flesh, and the head of a small salmon, for which he asked a
handkerchief, but afterwards accepted a few beads.  As this man came
alone, I concluded that no general plan had been formed among the
natives to annoy us, but this opinion did not altogether calm the
apprehensions of my people.</p>

<p>Soon after eight in the morning, I took five altitudes for time, and the
mean of them was 36° 48' at six in the afternoon, 58. 34. time, by the
watch, which makes the achrometer slow apparent time 1h 21m 44s.</p>

<p>Two canoes now arrived from the same quarter as the rest, with several
men, and our young Indian along with them.  They brought a very few
small sea-otter skins, out of season, with some pieces of raw seal's
flesh.  The former were of no value, but hunger compelled some of my
people to take the latter, at an extravagant price.  Mr.  Mackay lighted
a bit of touch-wood with a burning-glass, in the cover of his
tobacco-box, which so surprised the natives, that they exchanged the
best of their otter skins for it.  The young man was now very anxious to
per suede our people to depart, as the natives, he said, were as
numerous as musquitoes, and of very malignant character.  This
information produced some very earnest remonstrances to me to hasten our
departure, but as I was determined not to leave this place, except I was
absolutely compelled to it, till I had ascertained its situation, these
solicitations were not repeated.</p>

<p>While I was taking a meridian, two canoes, of a larger size, and well
manned, appeared from the main South-West channel.  They seemed to be
the fore-runners of others, who were coming to co-operate with the
people of the village, in consequence of the message sent by the two
boys, which has been already mentioned; and our young Indian, who
understood them, renewed his entreaties for our departure, as they would
soon come to shoot their arrows, and hurl their spears at us.  In
relating our dangers his agitation was so violent, that he foamed at the
mouth.  Though I was not altogether free from apprehensions on the
occasion, it was necessary for me disguise them, as my people were panic
struck, and some of them asked if it was my determination to remain
there to be sacrificed?  My reply was the same as their former
importunities had received, that I would not stir till I had
accomplished my object; at the same time, to humour their fears, I
consented that they should put everything into the canoe, that we might
be in a state of preparation to depart.  The two canoes now approached
the shore, and in a short time, five men, with their families, landed
very quietly from them.  My instruments being exposed, they examined
them with much apparent admiration and astonishment.  My altitude, by an
artificial horizon, gave 52° 21' 33"; that by the natural horizon was
52° 20' 48" North latitude.<a name="v2-c10-hl4" href="#v2-c10-hr4">[4]</a></p>

<p>These Indians were of a different tribe from those which I had already
seen, as our guide did not understand their language.  I now mixed up
some vermilion in melted grease, and inscribed, in large characters, on
the South-East face of the rock on which we had slept last night, this
brief memorial&mdash;"Alexander Mackenzie, from Canada, by land, the
twenty-second of July, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-three."</p>

<p>As I thought that we were too near the village, I consented to leave
this place, and accordingly proceeded North-East three miles, when we
landed on a point, in a small cove, where we should not be readily seen,
and could not be attacked except in our front.</p>

<p>Among other articles that had been stolen from us, at our last station,
was a sounding-line, which I intended to have employed in this bay, though
I should not probably have found the bottom, at any distance from the shore,
as the appearance both of the water and land indicated a great depth.  The
latter displayed a solid rock, rising as it appeared to me, from three
to seven hundred feet above high water mark.  Where any soil was
scattered about, there were cedars, spruce-firs, white birch, and other
trees of large growth.  From its precipices issued streams of fine
water, as cold as ice.</p>

<p>The two canoes which we had left at our last station, followed us
hither, and when they were preparing to depart, our young chief embarked
with them.  I was determined, however, to prevent his escape, and
compelled him, by animal force, to come on shore, for I thought it much
better to incur his displeasure than to suffer him to expose himself to
any untoward accident among strangers, or to return to his father before
us.  The men in the canoe made signs for him to go over the hill, and
that they would take him on board at the other side of it.  As I was
necessarily engaged in other matters, I desired my people to take care
that he should not run away; but they peremptorily refused to be
employed in keeping him against his will.  I was, therefore, reduced to
the necessity of watching him myself.</p>

<p>I took five altitudes, and the mean of them was 29. 23. 48, at
3. 5. 53. in the afternoon, by the watch, which makes it slow apparent
time.</p>

<p>I observed an emersion of Jupiter's third satellite, which gave 8° 32'
21. difference of longitude.  I then observed an emersion of Jupiter's
first satellite, which gave 8° 31' 48.  The mean of these observations
is 8° 32' 2. which is equal to 128. 2. West of Greenwich.</p>

<p>I had now determined my situation, which is the most fortunate
circumstance of my long, painful, and perilous journey, as a few cloudy
days would have prevented me from ascertaining the final longitude of
it.<a name="v2-c10-hl5" href="#v2-c10-hr5">[5]</a></p>

<p>At twelve it was high water, but the tide did not come within a foot and
an half of the high water mark of last night.  As soon as I had
completed my observations, we left this place: it was then ten o'clock
in the afternoon.  We returned the same way that we came, and though the
tide was running out very strong, by keeping close in with the rocks, we
proceeded at a considerable rate, as my people were very anxious to get
out of the reach of the inhabitants of this coast.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Tuesday, 23.</i>&mdash;During our course we saw several fires on the land to
the Southward, and after the day dawned, their smokes were visible.  At
half past four this morning we arrived at our encampment of the night of
the 21st, which had been named Porcupine Cove.  The tide was out, and
considerably lower than we found it when we were here before; the
high-water mark being above the place where we had made our fire.  This
fluctuation must be occasioned by the action of the wind upon the water,
in those narrow channels.</p>

<p>As we continued onwards, towards the river, we saw a canoe, well manned,
which at first made from us with great expedition, but afterwards
waited, as if to reconnoitre us; however, it kept out of our way, and
allowed us to pass.  The tide being much lower than when we were here
before, we were under the necessity of landing a mile below the village.
We observed that stakes were fixed in the ground along the bay, and in
some places machines were fastened to them, as I afterwards learned, to
intercept the seals and otters.  These works are very extensive, and
must have been erected with no common labour.  The only bird we saw
to-day was the white headed eagle.<a name="v2-c10-hl6" href="#v2-c10-hr6">[6]</a></p>

<p>Our guide directed us to draw the canoe out of the reach of the tide and
to leave it.  He would not wait, however, till this operation was
performed, and I did not wish to let him go alone.  I therefore followed
him through a bad road encumbered with under-wood.  When we had quitted
the wood, and were in sight of the houses, the young man being about
fifteen or twenty paces before me, I was surprised to see two men
running down towards me from one of the houses, with daggers in their
hands and fury in their aspect.  From their hostile appearance, I could
not doubt of their purpose.  I therefore stopped short, threw down my
cloak, and put myself in a posture of defence, with my gun presented
towards them.  Fortunately for me, they knew the effect of firearms, and
instantly dropped their daggers, which were fastened by a string to
their wrists, and had before been held in a menacing attitude.  I let my
gun also fall into my left hand, and drew my hanger.  Several others
soon joined them, who were armed in the same manner; and among them I
recognised the man whom I have already mentioned as being so troublesome
to us, and who now repeated the names of Macuba and Benzins, signifying
at the same time by his action, as on a former occasion, that he had
been shot at by them.  Until I saw him my mind was undisturbed; but the
moment he appeared, conceiving that he was the cause of my present
perilous situation, my resentment predominated, and if he had come
within my reach, I verily believe, that I should have terminated his
insolence forever.</p>

<p>The rest now approached so near, that one of them
contrived to get behind me, and grasped me in his arms.  I soon
disengaged myself from him; and, that he did not avail himself of the
opportunity which he had of plunging his dagger into me, I cannot
conjecture.  They certainly might have overpowered me, and though I
should probably have killed 
one or two of them, I must have fallen at last.</p>

<p>One of my people now came out of the wood.  On his appearance they
instantly took to flight, and with the utmost speed sought shelter in
the houses from whence they had issued.  It was, however, upwards of ten
minutes before all my people joined me; and as they came one after the
other, these people might have successively dispatched every one of us.
If they had killed me, in the first instance, this consequence would
certainly have followed, and not one of us would have returned home to
tell the horrid fate of his companions.</p>

<p>After having stated the danger I had encountered, I told my people that
I was determined to make these natives feel the impropriety of their
conduct toward us, and compel them to return my hat and cloak which they
had taken in the scuffle, as well as the articles previously purloined
from us, for most of the men who were in the three canoes that we first
saw, were now in the village.  I therefore told my men to prime their
pieces afresh, and prepare themselves for an active use of them, if the
occasion should require it.</p>

<p>We now drew up before the house, and made signs for some one to come
down to us.  At length our young chief appeared, and told us that the men
belonging to the canoes had not only informed his friends, that we had
treated him very ill, but that we had killed four of their companions whom
he had met in the bay.  When I had explained to them as well as it was in my
power, the falsehood of such a story, I insisted on the restoration of
everything that had been taken from us, as well as a necessary supply of
fish, as the conditions of my departure; accordingly the things were
restored, and a few dried fish along with them.  A reconciliation now took
place, but our guide or young chief was so much terrified that he would
remain no longer with us, and requested us to follow with his father's
canoe, or mischief would follow.  I determined, however, before my
departure, to take an observation, and at noon got a meridian altitude,
making this place, which I named Rascal's Village, 52. 23. 43. North
latitude.</p>

<p>On my informing the natives that we wanted something more to eat, they
brought us two salmon; and when we signified that we had no poles to set
the canoe against the current, they were furnished with equal alacrity,
so anxious were they for our departure.  I paid, however, for everything
which we had received, and did not forget the loan of the canoe.</p>

as I flatter myself has been proved by my former voyage.  Nor can I
refrain from expressing my surprise at his assertion, that there was an
inland sea or archipelago of great extent between the islands of Nootka
and the main, about the latitude where I was at this time.  Indeed I
have been informed that Captain Grey, who commanded an American vessel,
and on whose authority he ventured this opinion, denies that he had
given Mr. Meares any such information.  Besides, the contrary is
indubitably proved by Captain Vancouver's survey, from which no appeal
can be made.</p>

<h4><a name="chapter11" href="#toc_chapter11"> CHAPTER XI.</a></h4>

<p class="noindent">JULY, 1793.</p>

<p>The current of the river was so strong, that I should have complied with
the wishes of my people, and gone by land, but one of my Indians was so
weak, that it was impossible for him to perform the journey.  He had
been ill some time; and, indeed, we had been all of us more or less
afflicted with colds on the sea coast.  Four of the people therefore set
of with the canoe, and it employed them an hour to get half a mile.  In
the mean time the native, who has been already mentioned as having
treated us with so much insolence, and four of his companions, went up
the river in a canoe, which they had above the rapid, with as many boxes
as men in her.  This circumstance was the cause of fresh alarm, as it
was generally concluded that they would produce the same mischief and
danger in the villages above, as they had in that below.  Nor was it
forgotten that the young chief had left us in a manner which would not
be interpreted in our favour by his father and friends.</p>

<p>At length the canoe arrived, and the people declared in the most
unreserved terms, that they would proceed no further in her; but when
they were made acquainted with the circumstances which have just been
described, their violence increased, and the greater part of the men
announced their determination to attempt the mountains, and endeavour,
by passing over them, to gain the road by which we came to the first
village.  So resolved were they to pursue this plan, that they threw
everything which they had into the river, except their blankets.  I was
all this time sitting patiently on a stone, and indulging the hope that,
when their frantic terror had subsided, their returning reason would
have disposed them to perceive the rashness of their project; but when I
observed that they persisted in it, I no longer remained a silent
listener to their passionate declarations, but proceeded to employ such
arguments as I trusted would turn them from their senseless and
impracticable purpose.  After reproving my young Indian in very severe
terms, for encouraging the rest to follow their mad design of passing
the mountains, I addressed myself generally to them, stating the
difficulty of ascending the mountains, the eternal snows with which they
were covered, our small stock of provisions, which two days would
exhaust, and the consequent probability that we should perish with cold
and hunger.  I urged the folly of being affected by the alarm of danger
which might not exist, and if it did, I encouraged them with the means
we possessed of surmounting it.  Nor did I forget to urge the inhumanity
and injustice of leaving the poor sick Indian to languish and die.  I
also added, that as my particular object had been accomplished, I had
now no other but our common safety; that the sole wish of my heart was
to employ the best means in my power, and to pursue the best method
which my understanding could suggest, to secure them and myself from
every danger that might impede our return.</p>

<p>My steersman, who had been with me for five years in that capacity,
instantly replied that he was ready to follow me wherever I should go,
but that he would never again enter that canoe, as he had solemnly sworn
he would not, while he was in the rapid.  His example was followed by
all the rest, except two, who embarked with Mr. Mackay,<a name="v2-c11-hl1" href="#v2-c11-hr1">[1]</a> myself, and
the sick Indian.  The current, however, was so strong, that we dragged
up the greatest part of the way, by the branches of trees.  Our
progress, as may be imagined, was very tedious, and attended with
uncommon labour; the party who went by land being continually obliged to
wait for us.  Mr. Mackay's gun was carried out of the canoe and lost, at
a time when we appeared to stand in very great need of it, as two
canoes, with sixteen or eighteen men, were coming down the stream; and
the apprehensions which they occasioned did not subside till they shot
by us with great rapidity.</p>

<p>At length we came in sight of the house, when we saw our young Indian
with six others, in a canoe coming to meet us.  This was a very
encouraging circumstance, as it satisfied us that the natives who had
preceded, and whose malignant designs we had every reason to suspect,
had not been able to prejudice the people against us.  We, therefore,
landed at the house, where we were received in a friendly manner, and
having procured some fish, we proceeded on our journey.</p>

<p>It was almost dark when we arrived at the next house, and the first
persons who presented themselves to our observation were the turbulent
Indian and his four companions.  They were not very agreeable objects;
but we were nevertheless well received by the inhabitants, who presented
us with fish and berries.  The Indians who had caused us so much alarm,
we now discovered to be inhabitants of the islands, and traders in
various articles, such as cedar-bark, prepared to be wove into mats,
fish-spawn, copper, iron, and beads, the latter of which they get on
their own coast.  For these they receive in exchange roasted salmon,
hemlock bark cakes, and the other kind made of salmon roes, sorrel, and
bitter berries.  Having procured as much fish as would serve us for our
supper, and the meals of the next day, all my people went to rest except
one, with whom I kept the first watch.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Wednesday, 24.</i>&mdash;After twelve last night, I called up Mr. Mackay, and
one of the men, to relieve us, but as a general tranquillity appeared to
prevail in the place, I recommended them to return to their rest.  I was
the first awake in the morning, and sent Mr. Mackay to see if our canoe
remained where we left it; but he returned to inform me that the
Islanders had loaded it with their articles of traffic, and were ready
to depart.  On this intelligence I hurried to the water side, and
seizing the canoe by the stem, I should certainly have overset it, and
turned the three men that were in it, with all their merchandise, into
the river, had not one of the people of the house, who had been very
kind to us, informed me, that this was their own canoe, and that my
guide had gone off with ours.  At the same moment the other two Indians
who belonged to the party, jumped nimbly into it, and pushed off with
all the haste and hurry that their fears may be supposed to dictate.</p>

<p>We now found ourselves once more without a guide or a canoe.  We were,
however, so fortunate as to engage, without much difficulty, two of
these people to accompany us; as, from the strength of the current, it
would not have been possible for us to have proceeded by water without
their assistance.  As the house was upon an island, we ferried over the
pedestrian party to the main bank of the river and continued our course
till our conductors came to their fishing ground, when they proposed to
land us, and our small portion of baggage; but as our companions were on
the opposite shore, we could not acquiesce, and after some time
persuaded them to proceed further with us.  Soon after we met the chief
who had regaled us in our voyage down the river.  He was seining between
two canoes, and had taken a considerable quantity of salmon.  He took us
on board with him, and proceeded upwards with great expedition.  These
people are surprisingly skilful and active in setting against a strong
current.  In the roughest part they almost filled the canoe with water,
by way of a sportive alarm to us.</p>

<p>We landed at the house of the chief, and he immediately placed a fish
before me.  Our people now appeared on the opposite bank, when a canoe
was sent for them.  As soon as they had made their meal of fish, they
proceeded on their route, and we followed them; the chief and one of the
natives having undertaken to conduct us.</p>

<p>At five in the afternoon we came to two houses, which we had not seen in
going down.  They were upon an island, and I was obliged to send for the
walking party, as our conductors, from the lateness of the hour, refused
to proceed any further with us till the next day.  One of our men, being
at a small distance before the others, had been attacked by a female
bear with two cubs, but another of them arrived to his rescue, and shot
her.  Their fears probably prevented them from killing the two young
ones.  They brought a part of the meat, but it was very indifferent.  We
were informed, that our former guide, or young chief, had passed this
place, at a very early hour of the morning, on foot.</p>

<p>These people take plenty of another fish, besides salmon, which weigh
from fifteen to forty pounds.  This fish is broader than the salmon, of
a greyish colour, and with a hunch on its back: the flesh is white, but
neither rich nor well flavoured.  Its jaw and teeth are like those of a
dog, and the latter are larger and stronger than any I had ever seen in
a fish of equal size: those in front bend inwards, like the claws of a
bird of prey.  It delights in shallow water, and its native name is
Dilly.</p>

<p>We received as many fish and berries from these people as completely
satisfied our appetites.  The latter excelled any of the kind that we
had seen.  I saw also, three kinds of gooseberries, which, as we passed
through the woods, we found in great abundance.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Thursday, 25.</i>&mdash;I arose before the sun, and the weather was very
fine.  The men who were to accompany us went to visit their machines,
and brought back plenty of fish, which they strung on a rope, and left
them in the river.  We now embarked thirteen in a canoe, and landed my
men on the South bank, as it would have been impracticable to have
stemmed the tide with such a load.  The underwood was so thick that it
was with great difficulty they could pass through it.  At nine we were
under the necessity of waiting to ferry them over a river from the
South, which is not fordable.  After some time we came to two deserted
houses, at the foot of a rapid, beyond which our boatmen absolutely
refused to conduct us by water.  Here was a road which led opposite to
the village.  We had, however, the curiosity to visit the houses, which
were erected upon posts, and we suffered very severely for the
indulgence of it; for the doors were covered with fleas, and we were
immediately in the same condition, for which we had no remedy but to
take to the water.  There was not a spot round the houses free from
grass, that was not alive, as it were, with this vermin.</p>

<p>Our guides proposed to conduct us on our way, and we followed them on a
well-beaten track.  They, however, went so fast, that we could not all
of us keep up with them, particularly our sick Indian, whose situation
was very embarrassing to us, and at length they contrived to escape.  I
very much wished for these men to have accompanied us to the village, in
order to do away any ill impressions which might have arisen from the
young chief's report to his father, which we were naturally led to
expect would not be in our favour.</p>

<p>This road conducted us through the finest wood of cedar trees that I had
ever seen.  I measured several of them that were twenty-four feet in the
girth, and of a proportionate height.  The alder trees are also of an
uncommon size; several of them were seven feet and an half in
circumference, and rose to forty feet without a branch; but my men
declared that they had, in their progress, seen much larger of both
kinds.  The other wood was hemlock; white birch, two species of
spruce-firs, willows, &amp;c.  Many of the large cedars appeared to have
been examined, as I suppose by the natives, for the purpose of making
canoes, but finding them hollow at heart, they were suffered to stand.
There was but little underwood, and the soil was a black rich mould,
which would well reward the trouble of cultivation.  From the remains of
bones on certain spots, it is probable that the natives may have
occasionally burned their dead in this wood.</p>

<p>As it was uncertain what our reception might be at the village, I
examined every man's arms and ammunition, and gave Mr. Mackay, who had
unfortunately lost his gun, one of my pistols.  Our late conductors had
informed us that the man whom we left in a dying state, and to whom I
had administered some Turlington's balsam, was dead; and it was by no
means improbable that I might be suspected of hastening his end.</p>

<p>At one in the afternoon we came to the bank of the river, which was
opposite to the village, which appeared to be in a state of perfect
tranquillity.  Several of the natives were fishing above and below the
weir, and they very readily took us over in their canoes.  The people
now hurried down to the water side, but I perceived none of the chief's
family among them.  They made signs to me to go to his house; I
signified to them not to crowd about us, and indeed drew a line, beyond
which I made them understand they must not pass.  I now directed
Mr. Mackay, and the men to remain there, with their arms in readiness,
and to keep the natives at a distance, as I was determined to go alone
to the chief's house; and if they should hear the report of my pistols,
they were ordered to make the best of their way from these people, as it
would then be equally fruitless and dangerous to attempt the giving me
any assistance, as it would be only in the last extremity, and when I
was certain of their intention to destroy me, that I should discharge my
pistols.  My gun I gave to Mr. Mackay, when, with my loaded pistols in
my belt, and a poignard in my hand, I proceeded to the abode of the
chief.  I had a wood to pass in my way thither, which was intersected by
various paths and I took one that led to the back, instead of the front
of the house; and as the whole had been very much altered since I was
here before, I concluded that I had lost my way.  But I continued to
proceed, and soon met with the chief's wife, who informed me, that he
was at the next house.  On my going round it, I perceived that they had
thrown open the gable ends, and added two wings, nearly as long as the
body, both of which were hung round with salmon as close as they could
be placed.  As I could discover none of the men, I sat down upon a large
stone near some women who were supping on salmon roes and berries.  They
invited me to partake of their fare, and I was about to accept their
invitation when Mr. Mackay joined me, as both himself and all my party
were alarmed at my being alone.  Nor was his alarm lessened by an old
man whom he met in the wood, and who made use of signs to persuade him
to return.  As he came without his gun, I gave him one of my pistols.
When I saw the women continue their employment without paying the least
attention to us, I could not imagine that any hostile design was
preparing against us.  Though the non-appearance of the men awakened
some degree of suspicion that I should not be received with the same
welcome as on my former visit.  At length the chief appeared, and his
son, who had been our guide, following him; displeasure was painted in
the old man's countenance, and he held in his hand a bead tobacco pouch
which belonged to Mr. Mackay, and the young chief had purloined from
him.  When he had approached within three or four yards of me, he threw
it at me with great indignation, and walked away.  I followed him,
however, until he had passed his son, whom I took by the hand, but he
did not make any very cordial return to my salutation; at the same time
he made signs for me to discharge my pistol, and give him my hanger
which Mr.  Mackay had brought me, but I did not pay the least attention
to either of his demands.</p>

<p>We now joined the chief, who explained to me that he was in a state of
deep distress for the loss of his son, and made me understand that he
had cut off his hair and blackened his face on the melancholy occasion.
He also represented the alarm which he had suffered respecting his son
who had accompanied us; as he apprehended we had killed him, or had all
of us perished together.  When he had finished his narrative, I took him
and his son by their hands, and requested them to come with me to the
place where I had left my people, who were rejoiced to see us return,
having been in a state of great anxiety from our long absence.  I
immediately remunerated the young chief for his company and assistance
in our voyage to the sea, as well as his father, for his former
attentions.  I gave them cloth and knives, and, indeed, a portion of
everything which now remained to us.  The presents had the desired
effect of restoring us to their favour; but these people are of so
changeable a nature, that there is no security with them.  I procured
three robes and two otter-skins, and if I could have given such articles
in exchange as they preferred, I should probably have obtained more.  I
now represented the length of the way which I had to go, and requested
some fish to support us on our journey, when he desired us to follow him
to the house, where mats were immediately arranged and a fish placed
before each of us.</p>

<p>We were now informed, that our dog, whom we had lost, had been howling
about the village ever since we left it, and that they had reason to
believe he left the woods at night to eat the fish he could find about
the houses.  I immediately dispatched Mr. Mackay, and a man, in search
of the animal, but they returned without him.</p>

<p>When I manifested my intention to proceed on my journey, the chief
voluntarily sent for ten roasted salmon, and having attended us with his
son, and a great number of his people, to the last house in the village,
we took our leave.  It was then half past three in the afternoon.</p>

<p>I directed Mr. Mackay to take the lead, and the others to follow him in
Indian files, at a long and steady pace, as I determined to bring up the
rear.  I adopted this measure from a confusion that was observable among
the natives which I did not comprehend.  I was not without my suspicions
that some mischief was in agitation, and they were increased from the
confused noise we heard in the village.  At the same time a considerable
number came running after us; some of them making signs for us to stop,
and others rushing by me.  I perceived also, that those who followed us
were the strangers who live among these people, and are kept by them in
a state of awe and subjection; and one of them made signs to me that we
were taking a wrong road.  I immediately called out to Mr. Mackay to
stop.  This was naturally enough taken for an alarm, and threw my people
into great disorder.  When, however, I was understood, and we had
mustered again, our Indian informed us, that the noise we heard was
occasioned by a debate among the natives, whether they should stop us or
not.  When, therefore, we had got into the right road, I made such
arrangements as might be necessary for our defence, if we should have an
experimental proof that our late and fickle friends were converted into
enemies.</p>

<p>Our way was through a forest of stately cedars, beneath a range of lofty
hills, covered with rocks, and without any view of the river.  The path
was well beaten, but rendered incommodious by the large stones which lay
along it.</p>

<p>As we were continuing our route, we all felt the sensation of having
found a lost friend at the sight of our dog; but he appeared, in a great
degree, to have lost his former sagacity.  He ran in a wild way
backwards and forwards; and though he kept our road, I could not induce
him to acknowledge his master.  Sometimes he seemed disposed to approach
as if he knew us; and then, on a sudden, he would turn away, as if
alarmed at our appearance.  The poor animal was reduced almost to a
skeleton, and we occasionally dropped something to support him, and by
degrees he recovered his former sagacity.</p>

<p>When the night came on we stopped at a small distance from the river,
but did not venture to make a fire.  Every man took his tree, and laid
down in his clothes, and with his arms, beneath the shade of its
branches.  We had removed to a short distance from the path; no sentinel
was now appointed, and every one was left to watch for his own safety.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friday, 26.</i>&mdash;After a very restless, though undisturbed night, we set
forward as soon as day appeared, and walked on with all possible
expedition, till we got to the upper, which we now called Friendly
Village, and was the first we visited on our outward journey.</p>

<p>It was eight in the morning of a very fine day when we arrived, and
found a very material alteration in the place since we left it.  Five
additional houses had been erected and were filled with salmon: the
increase of inhabitants was in the same proportion.  We were received
with great kindness, and a messenger was dispatched to inform the chief,
whose name was Soocomlick, and who was then at his fishing-weir, of our
arrival.  He immediately returned to the village to confirm the cordial
reception of his people; and having conducted us to his house,
entertained us with the most respectful hospitality.  In short, he
behaved to us with so much attention and kindness, that I did not
withhold anything in my power to give, which might afford him
satisfaction.  I presented him with two yards of blue cloth, an axe,
knives, and various other articles.  He gave me in return a large shell
which resembled the under shell of a Guernsey oyster, but somewhat
larger.  Where they procured them I could not discover, but they cut and
polish them for bracelets, ear-rings, and other personal ornaments.  He
regretted that he had no sea-otter skins to give me, but engaged to
provide abundance of them whenever either my friends or myself should
return by sea; an expectation which I thought it right to encourage
among these people.  He also earnestly requested me to bring him a gun
and ammunition.  I might have procured many curious articles at this
place, but was prevented by the consideration that we must have carried
them on our backs upwards of three hundred miles through a mountainous
country.  The young chief, to his other acts of kindness, added as large
a supply of fish as we choose to take.</p>

<p>Our visit did not occasion any particular interruption of the ordinary
occupation of the people; especially of the women, who were employed in
boiling sorrel, and different kinds of berries, with salmon-roes, in
large square kettles of cedar wood.  This pottage, when it attained a
certain consistency, they took out with ladles, and poured it into
frames of about twelve inches square and one deep, the bottom being
covered with a large leaf, which were then exposed to the sun till their
contents became so many dried cakes.  The roes that are mixed up with
the bitter berries, are prepared in the same way.  From the quantity of
this kind of provision, it must be a principal article of food, and
probably of traffic.  These people have also portable chests of cedar,
in which they pack them, as well as their salmon, both dried and
roasted.  It appeared to me that they eat no flesh, except such as the
sea may afford them, as that of the sea-otter and the seal.  The only
instance we observed to the contrary, was in a young Indian who
accompanied us among the islands, and has been already mentioned as
feasting on the flesh of a porcupine; whether this be their custom
throughout the year, or only during the season of the salmon fishery;
or, whether there were any castes of them, as in India, I cannot pretend
to determine.  It is certain, however, that they are not hunters, and I
have already mentioned the abhorrence they expressed at some venison
which we brought to their village.  During our former visit to these
people, they requested us not to discharge our fire-arms, lest the
report should frighten away the salmon, but now they expressed a wish
that I should explain the use and management of them.  Though their
demeanour to us was of the most friendly nature, and they appeared
without any arms, except a few who accidentally had their daggers, I did
not think it altogether prudent to discharge our pieces; I therefore
fired one of my pistols at a tree marked for the purpose, when I put
four out of five buck shot with which it was loaded, into the circle, to
their extreme astonishment and admiration.</p>

<p>These people were in general of the middle stature, well set, and better
clothed with flesh than any of the natives of the interior country.
Their faces are round, with high cheek bones, and their complexion
between the olive and the copper.  They have small grey eyes, with a
tinge of red; they have wedge heads, and their hair is of a dark brown
colour, inclining to black.  Some wear it long, keep it well combed, and
let it hang loose over their shoulders, while they divide and tie it in
knots over the temples.  Others arrange its plaits, and bedaub it with
brown earth, so as to render it impervious to the comb; they, therefore,
carry a bodkin about them to ease the frequent irritation, which may be
supposed to proceed from such a state of the head.  The women are
inclined to be fat, wear their hair short, and appear to be very subject
to swelled legs, a malady that probably proceeds from the posture in
which they are always sitting: as they are chiefly employed in the
domestic engagements of spinning, weaving, preparing the fish, and
nursing their children, which did not appear to be numerous.  Their
cradle differed from any that I had seen; it consisted of a frame fixed
round a board of sufficient length, in which the child, after it has
been swathed, is placed on a bed of moss, and a conductor contrived to
carry off the urinary discharge.  They are slung over one shoulder by
means of a cord fastened under the other, so that the infant is always
in a position to be readily applied to the breast, when it requires
nourishment.  I saw several whose heads were inclosed in boards covered
with leather, till they attain the form of a wedge.  The women wear no
clothing but the robe, either loose or tied round the middle with a
girdle, as the occasion may require, with the addition of a fringed
apron, already mentioned, and a cap, in the form of an inverted bowl or
dish.  To the robe and cap, the men add, when it rains, a circular mat
with an opening in the middle sufficient to admit the head, which
extending over the shoulders, throws off the wet.  They also
occasionally wear shoes of dressed moose-skin, for which they are
indebted to their neighbors.  Those parts, which among all civilized
nations are covered from familiar view, are here openly exposed.</p>

<p>They are altogether dependent on the sea and rivers for their
sustenance, so that they may be considered as a stationary people; hence
it is that the men engage in those toilsome employments, which the
tribes who support themselves by the chase, leave entirely to the women.
Polygamy is permitted among them, though, according to my observation,
most of the men were satisfied with one wife, with whom, however,
chastity is not considered as a necessary virtue.  I saw but one woman
whose under lip was split and disfigured with an appendant ornament.
The men frequently bathe, and the boys are continually in the water.
They have nets and lines of various kinds and sizes, which are made of
cedar bark, and would not be known from those made of hemp.  Their hooks
consist of two pieces of wood or bone, forming when fixed together, an
obtuse angle.</p>

<p>Their spears or darts are from four to sixteen feet in length; the barb
or point being fixed in a socket, which, when the animal is struck,
slips from it: thus the barb being fastened by a string to the handle,
remains as a buoy; or enables the aquatic hunter to tire and take his
prey.  They are employed against sea-otters, seals, and large fish.</p>

<p>Their hatchets are made principally of about fourteen inches of
bar-iron, fixed into a wooden handle, as I have already described them;
though they have some of bone or horn: with these, a mallet and wooden
wedge, they hew their timbers and form their planks.  They must also
have other tools with which they complete and polish their work, but my
stay was so short, my anxiety so great, and my situation so critical,
that many circumstances may be supposed to have escaped me.</p>

<p>Their canoes are made out of the cedar tree, and will carry from eight
to fifty persons.</p>

<p>Their warlike weapons, which, as far as I could judge, they very seldom
have occasion to employ, are bows and arrows, spears, and daggers.  The
arrows are such as have been already described, but rather of a slighter
make.  The bows are not more than two feet and an half in length; they
are formed of a slip of red cedar; the grain being on one side untouched
with any tool, while the other is secured with sinews 'attached to it by
a kind of glue.  Though this weapon has a very slender appearance, it
throws an arrow with great force, and to a considerable distance.  Their
spears are about ten feet long, and pointed with iron.  Their daggers
are of various kinds, being of British, Spanish, and American
Manufacture.</p>

<p>Their household furniture consists of boxes, troughs, and dishes formed
of wood, with different vessels made of watape.  These are employed,
according to their several applications, to contain their valuables, and
provisions, as well as for culinary purposes, and to carry water.  The
women make use of muscle-shells to split and clean their fish, and which
are very well adapted to that purpose.</p>

<p>Their ornaments are necklaces, collars, bracelets for the arms, wrists,
and legs, with ear-rings, &amp;c.</p>

<p>They burn their dead, and display their mourning, by cutting their hair
short, and blackening their faces.  Though I saw several places where
bodies had been burned, I was surprised at not seeing any tomb or
memorial of the dead, particularly when their neighbours are so
superstitiously attentive to the erection and preservation of them.</p>

<p>From the number of their canoes, as well as the quantity of their chests
and boxes, to contain their moveables, as well as the insufficiency of
their houses, to guard against the rigours of a severe winter, and the
appearance of the ground around their habitations, it is evident that
these people reside here only during the summer or salmon season, which
does not probably last more than three months.  It may be reasonably
inferred, therefore, that they have villages on the sea-coast, which
they inhabit during the rest of the year.  There it may be supposed they
leave the sick, the infirm, and the aged; and thither they may bear the
ashes of those who die at the place of their summer residence.</p>

<p>Of their religion I can say but little, as my means of observation were
very contracted.  I could discover, however, that they believed in a
good and evil spirit: and that they have some forms of worship to
conciliate the protection of one, and perhaps to avert the enmity of the
other, is apparent from the temples which I have described; and where,
at stated periods, it may be presumed they hold the feasts, and perform
the sacrifices, which their religion, whatever it may be, has instituted
as the ceremonials of their public worship.</p>

<p>From the very little I could discover of their government, it is
altogether different from any political regulation which had been
remarked by me among the savage tribes.  It is on this river alone that
one man appears to have an exclusive and hereditary right to what was
necessary to the existence of those who are associated with him.  I
allude to the salmon weir, or fishing place, the sole right to which
confers on the chief an arbitrary power.  Those embankments could not
have been formed without a very great and associated labour; and, as
might be supposed, on the condition that those who assisted in
constructing it should enjoy a participating right in the advantages to
be derived from it.  Nevertheless, it evidently appeared to me, that the
chief's power over it, and the people, was unlimited, and without
control.  No one could fish without his permission, or carry home a
larger portion of what he had caught, than was set apart for him.  No
one could build a house without his consent; and all his commands
appeared to be followed with implicit obedience.  The people at large
seemed to be on a perfect equality, while the strangers among them were
obliged to obey the commands of the natives in general or quit the
village.  They appear to be of a friendly disposition, but they are
subject to sudden gusts of passion, which are as quickly composed; and
the transition is instantaneous, from violent irritation to the most
tranquil demeanor.  Of the many tribes of savage people whom I have
seen, these appear to be the most susceptible of civilization.  They
might soon be brought to cultivate the little ground about them which is
capable of it.  There is a narrow border of a rich black soil, on either
side of the river, over a bed of gravel, which would yield any grain or
fruit that are common to similar latitudes in Europe.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="v2-c11-hr1" href="#v2-c11-hl1">[1]</a> It is but common justice to him, to mention in this place that I had

<h4><a name="chapter12" href="#toc_chapter12"> CHAPTER XII.</a></h4>

<p class="noindent">JULY, 1793.</p>

<p>At eleven in the morning we left this place, which I called Friendly
Village, accompanied by every man belonging to it, who attended us about
a mile, when we took a cordial leave of them; and if we might judge from
appearances, they parted from us with regret.</p>

<p>In a short time we halted to make a division of our fish, and each man
had about twenty pounds weight of it, except Mr. Mackay and myself, who
were content with shorter allowance, that we might have less weight to
carry.  We had also a little flour, and some pemmican.  Having completed
this arrangement with all possible expedition, we proceeded onwards, the
ground rising gradually, as we continued our route.  When we were clear
of the wood, we saw the mountain towering above, and apparently of
impracticable ascent.  We soon came to the fork of the river, which was
at the foot of the precipice, where the ford was three feet deep, and
very rapid.  Our young Indian, though much recovered, was still too weak
to cross the water, and with some difficulty I carried him over on my
back.</p>

<p>It was now one in the afternoon, and we had to ascend the summit of the
first mountain before night came on, in order to look for water.  I left
the sick Indian, with his companion and one of my men, to follow us, as
his strength would permit him.  The fatigue of ascending these
precipices I shall not attempt to describe, and it was past five when we
arrived at a spot where we could get water, and in such an extremity of
weariness, that it was with great pain any of us could crawl about to
gather wood for the necessary purpose of making a fire.  To relieve our
anxiety, which began to increase every moment for the situation of the
Indian, about seven he and his companions arrived; when we consoled
ourselves by sitting round a blazing fire, talking of past dangers, and
indulging the delightful reflection that we were thus far advanced on
our homeward journey.  Nor was it possible to be in this situation
without contemplating the wonders of it.  Such was the depth of the
precipices below, and the height of the mountains above, with the rude
and wild magnificence of the scenery around, that I shall not attempt to
describe such an astonishing and awful combination of objects; of which,
indeed, no description can convey an adequate idea.  Even at this place,
which is only, as it were, the first step towards gaining the summit of
the mountains, the climate was very sensibly changed.  The air that
fanned the village which we left at noon, was mild and cheering; the
grass was verdant, and the wild fruits ripe around it.  But here the
snow was not yet dissolved, the ground was still bound by the frost, the
herbage had scarce begun to spring, and the crowberry bushes were just
beginning to blossom.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Saturday, 27.</i>&mdash;So great was our fatigue of yesterday, that it was
late before we proceeded to return over the mountains, by the same route
which we had followed in our outward journey.  There was little or no
change in the appearance of the mountains since we passed them, though
the weather was very fine.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sunday, 28.</i>&mdash;At nine this morning we arrived at the spot, where we
slept with the natives on the 16th instant, and found our pemmican in
good condition where we had buried it.</p>

<p>The latitude of this place, by observation, when I passed, I found to be
52. 46. 32.  I now took time, and the distance between sun and moon.  I
had also an azimuth, to ascertain the variation.</p>

<p>We continued our route with fine weather, and without meeting a single
person on our way, the natives being all gone, as we supposed, to the
Great River.  We recovered all our hidden stores of provisions, and
arrived about two in the afternoon of Sunday, August the 4th, at the
place which we had left a month before.</p>

<p>A considerable number of Indians were encamped on the opposite side of
the small river, and in consequence of the weather, confined to their
lodges: as they must have heard of, if not seen us, and our arms being
out of order from the rain, I was not satisfied with our situation; but
did not wish to create an alarm.  We, therefore, kept in the edge of the
wood, and called to them, when they turned out like so many furies, with
their arms in their hands, and threatening destruction if we dared to
approach their habitations.  We remained in our station till their
passion and apprehensions had subsided, when our interpreter gave them
the necessary information respecting us.  They proved to be strangers to
us, but were the relations of those whom we had already seen here, and
who, as they told us, were upon an island at some distance up the river.
A messenger was accordingly sent to inform them of our arrival.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Monday, 5.</i>&mdash;On examining the canoe, and our property, which we had
left behind, we found it in perfect safety, nor was there the print of a
foot near the spot.  We now pitched our tent, and made a blazing fire,
and I treated myself, as well as the people, with a dram; but we had
been so long without tasting any spirituous liquor, that we had lost all
relish for it.  The Indians now arrived from above, and were rewarded
for the care they had taken of our property with such articles as were
acceptable to them.</p>

<p>At nine this morning I sent five men in the canoe, for the various
articles we had left below, and they soon returned with them, and except
some bale goods, which had got wet, they were in good order,
particularly the provisions, of which we were now in great need.</p>

<p>Many of the natives arrived both from the upper and lower parts of the
river, each of whom was dressed in a beaver robe.  I purchased fifteen
of them; and they preferred large knives in exchange.  It is an
extraordinary circumstance, that these people, who might have taken all
the property we left behind us, without the least fear of detection,
should leave that untouched, and purloin any of our utensils, which our
confidence in their honesty gave them a ready opportunity of taking.  In
fact, several articles were missing, and as I was very anxious to avoid
a quarrel with the natives, in this stage of our journey, I told those
who remained near us, without any appearance of anger, that their
relations who were gone, had no idea of the mischief that would result
to them from taking our property.  I gravely added, that the salmon,
which was not only their favourite food, but absolutely necessary to
their existence, came from the see which belonged to us white men; and
that as, at the entrance of the river, we could prevent those fish from
coming up it, we possessed the power to starve them and their children.
To avert our anger, therefore, they must return all the articles that
had been stolen from us.  This finesse succeeded.  Messengers were
dispatched to order the restoration of everything that had been taken.
We purchased several large salmon of them and enjoyed the delicious meal
which they afforded.</p>

<p>At noon this day, which I allotted for repose, I got a meridian
altitude, which gave 53. 24. 10. I also took time.  The weather had been
cloudy at intervals.</p>

<p>Every necessary preparation had been made yesterday for us to continue
our route to-day; but before our departure, some of the natives arrived
with part of the stolen articles; the rest, they said, had been taken by
people down the river, who would be here in the course of the morning,
and recommended their children to our commiseration, and themselves to
our forgiveness.</p>

<p>The morning was cloudy, with small rain, nevertheless I ordered the men
to load the canoe, and we proceeded in high spirits on finding ourselves
once more so comfortably together in it.  We landed at a house on the
first island, where we procured a few salmon, and four fine beaver
skins.  There had been much more rain in these parts than in the country
above, as the water was pouring down the hills in torrents.  The river
consequently rose with great rapidity, and very much impeded our
progress.</p>

<p>The people on this river are generally of the middle size, though I saw
many tall men among them.  In the cleanliness of their persons they
resemble rather the Beaver Indians than the Chepewyans.  They are
ignorant of the use of fire arms, and their only weapons are bows and
arrows, and spears.  They catch the larger animals in snares, but though
their country abounds in them, and the rivers and lakes produce plenty
of fish, they find a difficulty in supporting themselves, and are never
to be seen but in small bands of two or three families.  There is no
regular government among them; nor do they appear to have a sufficient
communication or understanding with each other, to defend themselves
against an invading enemy, to whom they fall an easy prey.  They have
all the animals common on the West side of the mountains, except the
buffalo and the wolf; at least we saw none of the latter, and there
being none of the former, it is evident that their progress is from the
South-East.  The same language is spoken, with very little exception
from the extent of my travels down this river, and in a direct line from
the North-East head of it in the latitude 53.  or 54. to Hudson's Bay;
so that a Chepewyan, from which tribe they have all sprung, might leave
Churchill River, and proceeding in every direction to the North-West of
this line without knowing any language except his own, would understand
them all: I except the natives of the sea coast, who are altogether a
different people.  As to the people to the Eastward of this river, I am
not qualified to speak of them.</p>

<p>At twelve we ran our canoe upon a rock, so that we were obliged to land
in order to repair the injury she had received; and as the rain came on
with great violence, we remained here for the night.  The salmon were
now driving up the current in such large shoals, that the water seemed,
as it were, to be covered with the fins of them.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Wednesday, 7.</i>&mdash;About nine this morning the weather cleared, and we
embarked.  The shoals of salmon continued as yesterday.  There were
frequent showers throughout the day, and every brook was deluged into a
river.  The water had risen at least one foot and an half perpendicular
in the last twenty-four hours.  In the dusk of the evening we landed for
the night.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Thursday, 8.</i>&mdash;The water continued rising during the night; so that
we were disturbed twice in the course of it, to remove our baggage.  At
six in the morning we were on our way, and proceeded with continual and
laborious exertion, from the increased rapidity of the current.  After
having passed the two carrying places of Rocky Point, and the Long
Portage, we encamped for the night.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friday, 9.</i>&mdash;We set off at five, after a rainy night and in a foggy
morning.  The water still retained its height.  The sun, however, soon
beamed upon us; and our clothes and baggage were in such a state that we
landed to dry them.  After some time we re-embarked and arrived at our
first encampment on this river about seven in the evening.  The water
fell considerably in the course of the day.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Saturday, 10.</i>&mdash;The weather was cloudy with slight showers, and at
five this morning we embarked, the water falling as fast as it had
risen.  This circumstance arises from the mountainous state of the
country on either side of the river, from whence the water rushes down
almost as fast as it falls from the heavens, with the addition of the
snow it melts in its way.  At eight in the evening we stopped for the
night.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sunday, 11.</i>&mdash;At five this morning we proceeded with clear weather.
At ten we came to the foot of the long rapid, which we ascended with
poles much easier than we expected.  The rapids that were so strong and
violent in our passage downwards, were now so reduced, that we could
hardly believe them to be the same.  At sunset we landed and encamped.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Monday, 12.</i>&mdash;The weather was the same as yesterday, and we were on
the water at a very early hour.  At nine we came to a part of the river
where there was little or no current.  At noon we landed to gum the
canoe, when I took a meridian altitude, which gave 54. 11. 36. North
latitude.  We continued our route nearly East, and at three in the
afternoon approached the fork, when I took time, and the distance
between the sun and moon.  At four in the afternoon we left the main
branch.  The current was quite slack, as the water had fallen six feet,
which must have been in the course of three days.  At sunset we landed
and took our station for the night.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Tuesday, 13.</i>&mdash;There was a very heavy rain in the night, and the
morning was cloudy; we renewed our voyage, however, at a very early
hour, and came to the narrow gut between the mountains of rock, which
was a passage of some risk; but fortunately the state of the water was
such, that we got up without any difficulty, and had more time to
examine these extraordinary rocks than in our outward passage.  They are
as perpendicular as a wall, and give the idea of a succession of
enormous Gothic churches.  We were now closely hemmed in by the
mountains, which had lost much oh their snow since our former passage by
them.  We encamped at a late hour, cold, wet, and hungry: for such was
the state of our provisions, that our necessary allowance did not answer
to the active cravings of our appetites.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Wednesday, 14.</i>&mdash;The weather was cold and raw, with small rain, but
our necessities would not suffer us to wait for a favourable change of
it, and at half past five we arrived at the swampy carrying-place,
between this branch and the small river.  At three in the afternoon the
cold was extreme, and the men could not keep themselves warm even by
their violent exertions which our situation required; and I now gave
them the remainder of our rum to fortify and support them.  The canoe
was so heavy that the lives of two of them were endangered in this
horrible carrying-place.  At the same time it must be observed, that
from the fatiguing circumstances of our journey, and the inadequate
state of our provisions, the natural strength of the men had been
greatly diminished.  We encamped on the banks of the bad river.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Thursday, 15.</i>&mdash;The weather was now clear, and the sun shone upon us.
The water was much lower than in the downward passage, but was cold as
ice, and, unfortunately, the men were obliged to be continually in it to
drag on the canoe.  There were many embarras, through which a passage
might have been made, but we were under the necessity of carrying both
the canoe and baggage.</p>

<p>About sun-set we arrived at our encampment of the 13th of June, where
some of us had nearly taken our eternal voyage.  The legs and feet of
the men were so benumbed, that I was very apprehensive of the
consequence.  The water being low, we made a search for our bag of ball,
but without success.  The river was full of salmon, and another fish
like the black bass.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friday, 16.</i>&mdash;The weather continued to be the same as yesterday, and
at two in the afternoon we came to the carrying-place which leads to the
first small lake; but it was so filled with drift wood, that a
considerable portion of time was employed in making our way through it.
We now reached the high land which separates the source of the Tacoutche
Tesse, or Columbia River, and Unjigah, or Peace River: the latter of
which, after receiving many tributary streams, passes through the great
Slave Lake, and disembogues itself in the Frozen Ocean, in latitude
69. 30. North, longitude 135 West from Greenwich; while the former,
confined by the immense mountains that run nearly parallel with the
Pacific Ocean, and keep it in a Southern course, empties itself in
46. 20.  North latitude and longitude 124 West from Greenwich.</p>

<p>If I could have spared the time, and had been able to exert myself, for
I was now afflicted with a swelling in my ancles, so that I could not
even walk, but with great pain and difficulty, it was my intention to
have taken some salmon alive, and colonised them in the Peace River,
though it is very doubtful whether that fish would live in waters that
have not a communication with the sea.</p>

<p>Some of the inhabitants had been here since we passed; and I apprehend,
that on seeing our road through their country, they mistook us for
enemies, and had therefore deserted the place, which is a most
convenient station; as on one side, there is a great plenty of white
fish, and trout, jub, carp, &amp;c., and on the other abundance of salmon,
and probably other fish.  Several things that I had left here in
exchange for articles of which I had possessed myself, as objects of
curiosity, were taken away.  The hurtle-berries were now ripe, and very
fine of their kind.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Saturday, 17.</i>&mdash;The morning was cloudy, and at five we renewed our
progress.  We were compelled to carry from the lake to the Peace River,
the passage, from the falling of the water, being wholly obstructed by
drift wood.  The meadow through which we passed was entirely inundated;
and from the state of my foot and ancle, I was obliged, though with
great reluctance, to submit to be carried over it.</p>

<p>At half past seven we began to glide along with the current of the Peace
River; and almost at every canoe's length we perceived Beaver roads to
and from the river.  At two in the afternoon, an object attracted our
notice at the entrance of a small river, which proved to be the four
beaver skins, already mentioned to have been presented to me by a
native, and left in his possession to receive them on my return.  I
imagined, therefore, that being under the necessity of leaving the
river, or, perhaps, fearing to meet us again, he had taken this method
to restore them to me; and to reward his honesty, I left three times the
value of the skins in their place.  The snow appeared in patches on the
mountains.  At four in the afternoon we passed the place where we.
found the first natives, and landed for the night at a late hour.  In
the course of the day, we caught nine outards, or Canada geese, but they
were as yet without their feathers.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sunday, 18.</i>&mdash;As soon as it was light we proceeded on our voyage, and
drove on before the current, which was very much diminished in its
strength, since we came up it.  The water indeed, was so low, that in
many parts it exposed a gravelly beach.  At eleven we landed at our
encampment of the seventh of June, to gum the canoe and dry our clothes:
we then re-embarked, and at half past five arrived at the place, where I
lost my book of memorandums, on the fourth of June, in which were
certain courses and distances between that day end the twenty-sixth of
May, which I had now an opportunity to supply.  They were as follows:
North-North-West half a mile, East by North half a mile, North by East a
quarter of a mile, North-West by West a quarter of a mile,
West-South-West half a mile, North-West a mile and a quarter,
North-North-West three quarters of a mile, North by East half a mile,
North-West three quarters of a mile, West half a mile, North-West three
quarters of a mile, West-North-West one mile and a quarter, North three
quarters of a mile, West by North one quarter of a mile, North-West one
mile and an half, West-North-West half a mile, North-North-West three
quarters of a mile, West one quarter of a mile, North-North-East half a
mile, North-North-West two miles, and North-West four miles.</p>

<p>We were seven days in going up that part of the river which we came down
to-day; and it now swarmed, as it were, with beavers and wild fowl.
There was rain in the afternoon, and about sunset we took our station
for the night.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Monday, 19.</i>&mdash;We had some small rain throughout the night.  Our
course to-day was South-South-West three quarters of a mile,
West-North-West half a mile, North half a mile, North-West by West three
quarters of a mile, North by West half a mile; a small river to the
left, South-West by West three quarters of a mile, West-North-West a
mile and an half, North-West by North four miles, a rivulet on the
right, West-North-West three quarters of a mile; a considerable river
from the left, North-North-West two miles, North half a mile,
West-North-West one mile and a half; a rivulet on the right, North-West
by West one mile and a quarter, West-North-West one mile,
West-South-West a quarter of a mile, North-North-West half a mile,
North-West half a mile, West-South-West three quarters of a mile,
North-West by West three miles, West-South-West three quarters of a
mile, North-West by West one mile; a small river on the right,
South-West a quarter of a mile, West-North-West, islands, four miles and
a half, a river on the left, North half a mile, West a quarter of a
mile, North a quarter of a mile, North-West by West three quarters of a
mile, North-North-East three quarters of a mile, North-West by North
half a mile, West-North-West a mile and an half, and North-West by North
half a mile.  The mountains were covered with fresh snow, whose showers
had dissolved in rain before they reached us.  North-West three quarters
of a mile, South-West a quarter of a mile, North a mile and three
quarters, West-North-West a mile and a quarter, North-West a mile and a
half, North-North-West half a mile, West-North-West a quarter of a mile,
North half a mile; here the current was sleek: North-West by North half
a mile, North-West by West a quarter of a mile, North-North-West a
quarter of a mile, North-West by West one mile and a quarter, North half
a mile, North-East by North one mile and three quarters, South-West one
mile and a quarter, with an island, North by East one mile, North-West.
Here the other branch opened to us, at the distance of three quarters of
a mile.</p>

<p>I expected from the slackness of the current in this branch,
that the Western one would be high, but I found it equally low.  I had
every reason to believe that from the upper part of this branch, the
distance could not be great to the country through which I passed when I
left the Great River; but it has since been determined otherwise by Mr.
J. Finlay, who was sent to explore it, and found its navigation soon
terminated by falls and rapids.</p>

<p>The branches are about two hundred yards in breadth, and the water was
six feet lower than on our upward passage.  Our course, after the
junction, was North-North-West one mile, the rapid North-East down it
three quarters of a mile, North by West one mile and a quarter, North by
East one mile and an half, East by South one mile, North-East two miles
and an half, East-North-East a quarter of a mile; a rivulet; East by
South one mile and an half, North-East two miles, East-North-East one
mile, North-North-East a quarter of a mile, North-East by East-half a
mile, East-South-East a quarter of a mile, East-North-East half a mile,
North-East two miles, North-East by East two miles and a quarter,
South-East by East a quarter of a mile; a rivulet from the left; East by
North a mile and an half, East by South one mile, East-North-East one
mile and three quarters; a river on the right; North-North-East three
quarters of a mile, North-East a mile and a half, North-East by East a
mile and a quarter, East-North-East half a mile, and North-East by North
half a mile.  Here we landed at our encampment of the 27th of June, from
whence I dispatched a letter in an empty keg, as was mentioned in that
period of my journal, which set forth our existing state, progress, and
expectation.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Tuesday, 20.</i>&mdash;Though the weather was clear, we could not embark this
morning before five, as there was a rapid very near us, which required
daylight to run it, that we might not break our canoe on the rocks.  The
baggage we were obliged to carry.  Our course was North by East a mile
and an half, North-North-East a mile and a half down another rapid on
the West side; it requires great care to keep directly between the eddy
current, and that which was driving down with so much impetuosity.  We
then proceeded North-North-West, a river from the right; a mile and a
quarter, North-North-East a mile and a half, a river from the left;
North one mile and three quarters, North-East two miles, North-East by
East two miles and a quarter, East by North one mile, North-East by East
four miles, a river from the left, and East by South a mile and a half.
Here was our encampment on the 26th of May, beyond which it would be
altogether superfluous for me to take the courses, as they are inserted
in their proper places.</p>

<p>As we continued our voyage, our attention was attracted by the
appearance of an Indian encampment.  We accordingly landed, and found
there had been five fires, and within that number of days, so that there
must have been some inhabitants in the neighbourhood, though we were not
so fortunate as to see them.  It appeared that they had killed a number
of animals, and fled in a state of alarm, as three of their canoes were
left carelessly on the beach, and their paddles laying about in
disorder.  We soon after came to the carrying-place called the Portage
de la Montagne de Roche.  Here I had a meridian altitude, which made the
latitude 56. 3. 51.  North.</p>

<p>The water, as I have already observed, was much lower than when we came
up it, though at the same time the current appeared to be stronger from
this place to the forks; the navigation, however, would now be attended
with greater facility, as there is a stony beach all the way, so that
poles, or the towing-line, may be employed with the best effect, where
the current overpowers the use of paddles.</p>

<p>We were now reduced to a very short allowance; the disappointment,
therefore, at not seeing any animals was proportioned to our exigencies,
as we did not possess at this time more than was sufficient to serve us
for two meals.  I now dispatched Mr. Mackay and the Indians to proceed
to the foot of the rapids, and endeavour in their way to procure some
provisions, while I prepared to employ the utmost expedition in getting
there; having determined, notwithstanding the disinclination of my
people, from the recollection of what they had suffered in coming that
way, to return by the same route.  I had observed, indeed, that the
water which had fallen fifteen feet perpendicular, at the narrow pass
below us, had lost much of its former turbulence.</p>

<p>As dispatch was essential in procuring a supply of provisions, we did
not delay a moment in making preparation to renew our progress.  Five of
the men began to carry the baggage, while the sixth and myself took the
canoe asunder, to cleanse her of the dirt, and expose her lining and
timbers to the air, which would render her much lighter.  About sun-set
Mr. Mackay and our hunters returned with heavy burdens of the flesh of a
buffalo: though not very tender, it was very acceptable, and was the
only animal that they had seen, though the country was covered with
tracks of them, as well as of the moose-deer and the elk.  The former
had done rutting, and the latter were beginning to run.  Our people
returned, having left their loads mid-way on the carrying-place.  My
companion and myself completed our undertaking, and the canoe was ready
to be carried in the morning.  A hearty meal concluded the day, and
every fear of future want was removed.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Wednesday, 21.</i>&mdash;When the morning dawned we set forwards, but as a
fire had passed through the portage, it was with difficulty we could
trace our road in many parts; and with all the exertion of which we were
capable, we did not arrive at the river till four in the afternoon.  We
found almost as much difficulty in carrying our canoe down the mountain
as we had in getting it up; the men being not so strong as on the former
occasion, though they were in better spirits; and I was now enabled to
assist them, my ancle being almost well.  We could not, however, proceed
any further till the following day, as we had the canoe to gum, with
several great and small poles to prepare; those we had left here having
been carried away by the water, though we had left them in a position
from fifteen to twenty feet above the water-mark, at that time.  These
occupations employed us till a very late hour.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Thursday, 22.</i>&mdash;The night was cold, and though the morning was fine
and clear, it was seven before we were in a state of preparation to
leave this place, sometimes driving with the current, and at other times
shooting the rapids.  The latter had lost much of their former strength;
but we, nevertheless, thought it necessary to land very frequently, in
order to examine the rapids before we could venture to run them.
However, the canoe being light, we very fortunately passed them all, and
at noon arrived at the place where I appointed to meet Mr. Mackay and
the hunters: there we found them, with plenty of excellent fat meat,
ready roasted, as they had killed two elks within a few hundred yards of
the spot where we then were.  When the men had satisfied their
appetites, I sent them for as much of the meat as they could carry.  In
coming hither, Mr. Mackay informed me, that he and the hunters kept
along the high land, and did not see or cross the Indian path.  At the
same time, there can be no doubt but the road from this place to the
upper part of the rapids is to be preferred to that which we came, both
for expedition and safety.</p>

<p>After staying here about an hour and a half, we proceeded with the
stream, and landed where I had forgotten my pipe-tomahawk and seal, on
the eighteenth of May.  The former of them I now recovered.

On leaving the mountains we saw animals grazing in every direction.  In
passing along an island, we fired at an elk, and broke its leg; and as it
was now time to encamp, we landed; when the hunters pursued the wounded
animal, which had crossed over to the main land, but could not get up
the bank.  We went after it, therefore, in the canoe, and killed it.  To
give some notion of our appetites, I shall state the elk, or at least
the carcase of it, which we brought away, to have weighed two hundred
and fifty pounds; and as we had taken a very hearty meal at one o'clock,
it might naturally be supposed that we should not be very voracious at
supper; nevertheless, a kettle full of the elk flesh was boiled and
eaten, and that vessel replenished and put on the fire.  All that
remained, with the bones, &amp;c. was placed, after the Indian fashion,
round the fire to roast, and at ten next morning the whole was consumed
by ten persons and a large dog, who was allowed his share of the
banquet.  This is no exaggeration; nor did any inconvenience result from
what may be considered as an inordinate indulgence.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friday, 23.</i>&mdash;We were on the water before daylight; and when the sun
rose, a beautiful country appeared around us, enriched and animated by
large herds of wild cattle.  The weather was now so warm, that to us,
who had not of late been accustomed to heat, it was overwhelming and
oppressive.  In the course of this day we killed a buffalo and a bear;
but we were now in the midst of abundance, and they were not
sufficiently fat to satisfy our fastidious appetites, so we left them
where they fell.  We landed for the night, and prepared ourselves for
arriving at the Fort on the following day.</p>


<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Saturday, 24.</i>&mdash;The weather was the same as yesterday, and the
country increasing in beauty; though as we approached the Fort, the
cattle appeared proportionably to diminish.  We now landed at two lodges
of Indians, who were as astonished to see us, as if we had been the
first white men whom they had ever beheld.  When we had passed these
people, not an animal was to be seen on the borders of the river.</p>

<p>At length, as we rounded a point, and came in view of the Fort, we threw
out a flag, and accompanied it with a general discharge of our
fire-arms; while the men were in such spirits, and made such an active
use of their paddles, that we arrived before the two men whom we left
here in the spring, could recover their senses to answer us.  Thus we
landed at four in the afternoon, at the place which we left on the ninth
of May.<br>

&mdash;&mdash;Here my voyages of discovery terminate.<br>


Their toils and their dangers, their solicitudes and sufferings, have
not been exaggerated in my description.  On the contrary, in many
instances, language has failed me in the attempt to describe them.  I
received, however, the reward of my labours, for they were crowned with
success.</p>

<p>As I have now resumed the character of a trader I shall not trouble my
readers with any subsequent concern, but content myself with the closing
infomation, that after an absence of eleven months, I arrived at Fort
Chepewyan, where I remained, for the purposes of trade, during the
succeeding winter.</p>

<hr width="20%">

<p>The following general, but short, geographical view of the country may
not be improper to close this work, as well as some remarks on the
probable advantages that may be derived from advancing the trade of it,
under proper regulations, and by the spirit of commercial enterprize.</p>

<p>By supposing a line from the Atlantic, East, to the Pacific, West, in
the parallel of forty-five degrees of North latitude, it will, I think,
nearly describe the British territories in North America.  For I am of
opinion, that the extent of the country to the South of this line, which
we have a right to claim, is equal to that to the North of it, which may
be claimed by other powers.</p>

<p>The outline of what I shall call the first division, is along that track
of country which runs from the head of James-Bay, in about latitude
51. North, along the Eastern coast, as far North as to, and through
Hudson's Straits, round by Labrador; continuing on the Atlantic coast,
on the outside of the great islands, in the gulf of St. Laurence, to the
river St. Croix, by which it takes its course, to the height of land
that divides the waters emptying themselves into the Atlantic, from
those discharged into the river St. Laurence.  Then following these
heights, as the boundary between the British possessions, and those of
the American States, it makes an angle Westerly until it strikes the
discharge of Lake Champlain, in latitude 45. North, when it keeps a
direct West line till it strikes the river St. Laurence, above Lake
St. Francis, where it divides the Indian village St. Rigest; from whence
it follows the centre of the waters of the great river St. Laurence: it
then proceeds through Lake Ontario, the connection between it and Lake
Erie; through the latter, and its chain of connection, by the river
Detroit, as far South as latitude 42.  North, and then through the lake
and river St. Clair, as also lake Huron, through which it continues to
the strait of St. Mary, latitude 46. 30. North; from which we will
suppose the line to strike to the East of North, to the head of James
Bay, in the latitude already mentioned.</p>

<p>Of this great tract, more than half is represented as barren and broken,
displaying a surface of rock and fresh water lakes, with a very
scattered and scanty proportion of soil.  Such is the whole coast of
Labrador, and the land, called East Main to the West of the heights,
which divide the waters running into the river and gulf of St. Laurence,
from those flowing into Hudson's Bay.  It is consequently inhabited only
by a few savages, whose numbers are proportioned to the scantiness of
the soil; nor is it probable, from the same cause, that they will
encrease.  The fresh and salt waters, with a small quantity of game,
which the few, stinted woods afford, supply the wants of nature; from
whence, to that of the line of the American boundary, and the Atlantic
Ocean, the soil, wherever cultivation has been attempted, has yielded
abundance; particularly on the river St. Laurence, from Quebec upwards,
to the line of boundary already mentioned; but a very inconsiderable
proportion of it has been broken by the plough-share.</p>

<p>The line of the second division may be traced from that of the first at
St. Mary's, from which also the line of American boundary runs, and is
said to continue through Lake Superior (and through a lake called the
Long Lake which has no existence), to the Lake of the Woods, in latitude
49. 37. North, from whence it is also said to run West to the
Mississippi, which it may do, by giving it a good deal of Southing, but
not otherwise; as the source of that river does not extend further North
than latitude 47. 38. North, where it is no more than a small brook;
consequently, if Great Britain retains the right of entering it along
the line of division, it must be in a lower latitude, and wherever that
may be, the line must be continued West, till it terminates in the
Pacific Ocean, to the South of the Columbia.  This division is then
bounded by the Pacific Ocean on the West, the Frozen Sea and Hudson's
Bay on the North and East.  The Russians, indeed, may claim with
justice, the islands and coast from Behring's Straits to Cook's Entry.</p>

<p>The whole of this country will long continue in the possession of its
present inhabitants, as they will remain contented with the produce of
the woods and waters for their support, leaving the earth, from various
causes, in its virgin state.  The proportion of it that is fit for
cultivation, is very small and is still less in the interior parts; it
is also very difficult of access; and whilst any land remains
uncultivated to the South of it, there will be no temptation to settle
it.  Besides, its climate is not in general sufficiently genial to bring
the fruits of the earth to maturity.  It will also be an asylum for the
descendants of the original inhabitants of the country to the South, who
prefer the modes of life of their forefathers, to the improvements of
civilization.  Of this disposition there is a recent instance.  A small
colony of Iroquois emigrated to the banks of the Saskatchiwine, in 1799,
who had been brought up from their infancy under the Romish
missionaries, and instructed by them at a village within nine miles of
Montreal.</p>

<p>A further division of this country is marked by a ridge of high land,
rising, as it were, from the coast of Labrador, and running nearly
South-West to the source of the Utawas River, dividing the waters going
either way to the river and gulf of St. Laurence and Hudson's Bay, as
before observed.  From thence it stretches to the North of West, to the
Northward of Lake Superior, to latitude 50. North, and longitude
98. West, when it forks from the last course at about South-West, and
continues the same division of waters until it passes North of the
source of the Mississippi.  The former course runs, as has been
observed, in a North-West direction, until it strikes the river Nelson,
separating the waters that discharge themselves into Lake Winipic, which
forms part of the said river, and those that also empty themselves into
Hudson's Bay, by the Albany, Severn, and Hay's or Hill's Rivers.  From
thence it keeps a course of about West-North-West, till it forms the
banks of the Missinipi or Churchill River, at Portage de Traite,
latitude 55. 25. North.  It now continues in a Western direction,
between the Saskatchiwine and the source of the Missinipi, or Beaver
River, which it leaves behind, and divides the Saskatchiwine from the
Elk River; when, leaving those also behind, and pursuing the same
direction it leads to the high land that lies between the Unjigah and
Tacoutche rivers, from whence it may be supposed to be the same ridge.
From the head of the Beaver River, on the West, the same kind of high
ground runs to the East of North, between the waters of the Elk and
Missinipi River forming the Portage la Loche, and continuing on to the
latitude 57. 15. North, dividing the waters that run to Hudson's Bay
from those going to the North Sea: from thence its course is nearly
North, when an angle runs from it to the North of the Slave Lake, till
it strikes Mackenzie's River.</p>

<p>The last, but by no means the least, is the immense ridge, or succession
of ridges of stony mountains, whose Northern extremity dips in the North
Sea, in latitude 70. North, and longitude 135. West, running nearly
South-East, and begins to be parallel with the coast of the Pacific
Ocean, from Cook's entry, and so onwards to the Columbia.  From thence
it appears to quit the coast, but still continuing, with less elevation,
to divide the waters of the Atlantic from those which run into the
Pacific.  In those snow-clad mountains rises the Mississippi, if we
admit the Missouri to be its source, which flows into the Gulph of
Mexico; the River Nelson, which is lost in Hudson's Bay; Mackenzie's
River, that discharges itself into the North Sea; and the Columbia
emptying itself into the Pacific Ocean.  The great River St. Laurence
and Churchill River, with many lesser ones, derive their sources far
short of these mountains.  It is, indeed, the extension of these
mountains so far South on the sea coast, that prevents the Columbia from
finding a more direct course to the sea, as it runs obliquely with the
coast upwards of eight degrees of latitude before it mingles with the
ocean.</p>

<p>It is further to be observed, that these mountains, from Cook's entry to
the Columbia, extend from six to eight degrees in breadth Easterly; and
that along their Eastern skirts is a narrow strip of very marshy, boggy,
and uneven ground, the outer edge of which produces coal and bitumen:
these I saw on the banks of Mackenzie's River, as far North as latitude
66.  I also discovered them in my second journey, at the commencement of
the rocky mountains in 56. North latitude, and 120. West longitude; and
the same was observed by Mr. Fidler, one of the servants of the Hudson's
Bay Company, at the source of the South branch of the Saskatchiwine, in
about latitude 52 North, and longitude 112. 30. West.<a name="v2-c12-hl1" href="#v2-c12-hr1">[1]</a> Next to this
narrow belt are immense plains, or meadows, commencing in a point at
about the junction of the River of the Mountain with Mackenzie's River,
widening as they continue East and South, till they reach the Red River
at its confluence with the Assiniboin River, from whence they take a
more Southern direction, along the Mississippi towards Mexico.
Adjoining to these plains is a broken country, composed of lakes, rocks,
and soil.</p>

<p>From the banks of the rivers running through the plains, there appeared
to ooze a saline fluid, concreting into a thin, scurf on the grass.
Near that part of the Slave River where it first loses the name of Peace
River, and along the extreme edge of these plains, are very strong salt
springs, which in the summer concrete and crystallize in great
quantities.  About the Lake Dauphin, on the South-West side of Lake
Winipic, are also many salt ponds, but it requires a regular process to
form salt from them.  Along the West banks of the former is to be seen,
at intervals, and traced in the line of the direction of the plains, a
soft rock of lime-stone, in thin and nearly horizontal stratas,
particularly on the Beaver, Cedar, Winipic, and Superior lakes, as also
in the beds of the rivers crossing that line.  It is also remarkable
that, at the narrowest part of Lake Winipic, where it is not more than
two miles in breadth, the West side is faced with rocks of this stone
thirty feet perpendicular; while, on the East side, the rocks are more
elevated, and of a dark-grey granite.</p>

<p>The latter is to be found throughout the whole extent North of this
country, to the coast of Hudson's Bay, and as I have been informed,
along that coast, onwards to the coast of Labrador; and it may be
further observed, that between these extensive ranges of granite and
lime-stone are found all the great lakes of this country.</p>

<p>There is another very large district which must not be forgotten; and
behind all the others in situation as well as in soil, produce, and
climate.  This comprehends the tract called the Barren Grounds, which is
to the North of a line drawn from Churchill, along the North border of
the Rein-Deer Lake, to the North of the Lake of the Hills and Slave
Lake, and along the North side of the latter to the rocky mountains,
which terminate in the North Sea, latitude 70. North, and longitude
135. West; in the whole extent of which no trees are visible, except a
few stinted ones, scattered along its rivers, and with scarce anything
of surface that can be called earth; yet, this inhospitable region is
inhabited by a people who are accustomed to the life it requires.  Nor
has bountiful nature withheld the means of subsistence; the rein deer,
which supply both food and clothing, are satisfied with the produce of
the hills, though they bear nothing but a short curling moss, on a
species of which, that grows on the rocks, the people themselves subsist
when famine invades them.  Their small lakes are not furnished with a
great variety of fish, but such as they produce are excellent, which,
with hares and partridges, form a proportion of their food.</p>

<p>The climate must necessarily be severe in such a country as we have
described, and which displays so large a surface of fresh water.  Its
severity is extreme on the coast of Hudson's Bay, and proceeds from its
immediate exposure to the North West winds that blow off the Frozen
Ocean.</p>

<p>These winds, in crossing directly from the bay over Canada and
the British dominions on the Atlantic, as well as over the Eastern
States of North America to that ocean, (where they give to those
countries a length of winter astonishing to the inhabitants of the same
latitudes in Europe), continue to retain a great degree of force and
cold in their passage, even over the Atlantic, particularly at
the time
when the sun is in its Southern declination.  The same winds which come
from the Frozen Ocean, over the barren grounds, and across frozen lakes
and snowy plains, bounded by the rocky mountains, lose their frigid
influence, as they travel in a Southern direction, till they get to the
Atlantic Ocean, where they close their progress.  Is not this a
sufficient cause for the difference between the climate in America, and
that of the same latitude in Europe?</p>

<p>It has been frequently advanced, that the clearing away the wood has had
an astonishing influence in meliorating the climate in the former: but I
am not disposed to assent to that opinion in the extent which it
proposes to establish, when I consider the very trifling proportion of
the country cleared, compared with the whole.  The employment of the axe
may have had some inconsiderable effect; but I look to other causes.  I
myself observed in a country, which was in an absolute state of nature,
that the climate is improving; and this circumstance was confirmed to me
by the native inhabitants of it.  Such a change, therefore, must proceed
from some predominating operation in the system of the globe which is
beyond my conjecture, and, indeed, above my comprehension, and may,
probably, in the course, of time, give to America the climate of Europe.
It is well known, indeed, 
that the waters are decreasing there, and that
many lakes are draining and filling up by the earth which is carried
into them from the higher lands by the rivers: and this may have some
partial effect.</p>

<p>The climate on the West coast of America assimilates much more to that
of Europe in the same latitudes: I think very little difference will be
found, except such as proceed from the vicinity of high mountains
covered with snow.  This is an additional proof that the difference in
the temperature of the air proceeds from the cause already mentioned.</p>

<p>Much has been said, and much more still remains to be said on the
peopling of America.&mdash;On this subject I shall confine myself to one or
two observations, and leave my readers to draw their inferences from
them.</p>

<p>The progress of the inhabitants of the country immediately under our
observation, which is comprised within the line of latitude 45. North,
is as follows: that of the Esquimaux, who possess the sea coast from the
Atlantic through Hudson's Straits and Bay, round to Mackenzie's River
(and I believe further), is known to be Westward; they never quit the
coast, and agree in appearance, manners, language, and habits with the
inhabitants of Greenland.  The different tribes whom I describe under
the name of Algonquins and Knisteneaux, but originally the same people,
were the inhabitants of the Atlantic coast, and the banks of the river
St.  Laurence and adjacent countries: their progress is Westerly, and
they are even found West and North as far as Athabasca.  On the
contrary, the Chepewyans, and the numerous tribes who speak their
language, occupy the whole space between the Knisteneaux country and
that of the Esquimaux, stretching behind the natives of the coast of the
Pacific, to latitude 52. North, on the river Columbia.  Their progress
is Easterly, and, according to their own traditions, they came from
Siberia; agreeing in dress and manner with the people now found upon the
coast of Asia.</p>

<p>Of the inhabitants of the coast of the Pacific Ocean we know little more
than that they are stationary there.  The Nadowasis or Assiniboins, as
well as the different tribes not particularly described, inhabiting the
plains on and about the source and banks of the Saskatchiwine and
Assiniboin rivers, are from the Southward, and their progress is
North-West.</p>

<hr width="20%">
<p>The discovery of a passage by sea, North-East or North West from the
Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, has for many years excited the attention
of governments, and encouraged the enterprising spirit of individuals.
The non-existence, however, of any such practical passage being at
length determined, the practicability of a passage through the
continents of Asia and America becomes an object of consideration.  The
Russians, who first discovered, that, along the coasts of Asia no useful
or regular navigation existed, opened an interior communication by
rivers, &amp;c., and through that long and wide-extended continent, to the
strait that separates Asia from America, over which they passed to the
adjacent islands and continent of the latter.  Our situation, at length,
is in some degree similar to theirs: the non-existence of a practicable
passage by sea and the existence of one through the continent, are
clearly proved; and it requires only the countenance and support of the
British Government, to increase in a very ample proportion this national
advantage, and secure the trade of that country to its subjects.</p>

<p>Experience, however, has proved, that this trade, from its very nature
cannot be carried on by individuals.  A very large capital, or credit,
or indeed both, is necessary, and consequently an association of men of
wealth to direct, with men of enterprise to act, in one common interest,
must be formed on such principles, as that in due time the latter may
succeed the former, in continual and progressive succession.  Such was
the equitable and successful mode adopted by the merchants from Canada,
which has been already described.</p>

<p>The junction of such a commercial association with the Hudson's Bay
Company, is the important measure which I would propose, and the trade
might then be carried on with a very superior degree of advantage, both
private and public, under the privilege of their charter, and would
prove, in fact, the complete fulfilment of the conditions, on which it
was first granted.</p>

<p>It would be an equal injustice to either party to be excluded from the
option of such an undertaking; for if the one has a right by charter,
has not the other a right by prior possession, as being successor to the
subjects of France, who were exclusively possessed of all the then known
parts of this country, before Canada was ceded to Great Britain, except
the coast of Hudson's Bay, and having themselves been the discoverers of
a vast extent of country since added to his Majesty's territories, even
to the Hyperborean and the Pacific Oceans?</p>

<p>If, therefore, that company should decline, or be averse to engage in,
such an extensive, and perhaps hazardous undertaking, it would not,
surely, be an unreasonable proposal to them, from government, to give up
a right which they refuse to exercise, on allowing them a just and
reasonable indemnification of their stock, regulated by the average
dividends of a certain number of years, or the actual price at which
they transfer their stock.</p>

<p>By enjoying the privilege of the company's charter, though but for a
limited period, there are adventurers who would be willing, as they are
able, to engage in, and carry on the proposed commercial undertaking, as
well as to give the most ample and satisfactory security to government
for the fulfilment of its contract with the company.  It would, at the
same time, be equally necessary to add a similar privilege of trade on
the Columbia River, and its tributary waters.</p>

<p>If, however, it should appear, that the Hudson's Bay Company have an
exclusive right to carry on their trade as they think proper, and
continue it on the narrow scale, and with so little benefit to the
public as they now do; if they should refuse to enter into a
co-operative junction with others, what reasonable cause can they assign
to government for denying the navigation of the bay to Nelson's River:
and, by its waters, a passage to and from the interior country, for the
use of the adventurers, and for the sole purpose of transport, under the
most severe and binding restrictions not to interfere with their trade
on the coast, and the country between it and the actual establishments
of the Canadian traders.<a name="v2-c12-hl2" href="#v2-c12-hr2">[2]</a></p>

<p>By these waters that discharge themselves into Hudson's Bay at Port
Nelson, it is proposed to carry on the trade to their source, at the
head of the Saskatchiwine River, which rises in the Rocky Mountains, not
eight degrees of longitude from the Pacific Ocean.  The Tacoutche or
Columbia River flows also from the same mountains, and discharges itself
likewise in the Pacific, in latitude 46. 20.  Both of them are capable
of receiving ships at their mouths, and are navigable throughout for
boats.</p>

<p>The distance between these waters is only known from the report of the
Indians.  If, however, this communication should prove inaccessible, the
route I pursued, though longer, in consequence of the great angle it
makes to the North, will answer every necessary purpose.  But whatever
course may be taken from the Atlantic, the Columbia is the line of
communication from the Pacific Ocean, pointed out by nature, as it is
the only navigable river in the whole extent of Vancouver's minute
survey of that coast: its banks also form the first level country in all
the Southern extent of continental coast from Cook's entry, and,
consequently, the most Northern situation fit for colonization, and
suitable to the residence of a civilized people.  By opening this
intercourse between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and forming regular
establishments through the interior, and at both extremes, as well as
along the coasts and islands, the entire command of the fur trade of
North America might be obtained, from latitude 48. North to the pole,
except that portion of it which the Russians have in the Pacific.  To
this may be added the fishing in both seas, and the markets of the four
quarters of the globe.  Such would be the field for commercial
enterprise, and incalculable would be the produce of it, when supported
by the operations of that credit and capital which Great Britain so
pre-eminently possesses.  Then would this country begin to be
remunerated for the expences it has sustained in discovering and
surveying the coast of the Pacific Ocean, which is at present left to
American adventurers, who without regularity or capital, or the desire
of conciliating future confidence, look altogether to the interest of
the moment.  They, therefore, collect all the skins they can procure,
and in any manner that suits them, and having exchanged them at Canton
for the produce of China, return to their own country.  Such
adventurers, and many of them, as I have been informed, have been very
successful, would instantly disappear from before a well-regulated
trade.</p>

<p>It would be very unbecoming in me to suppose for a moment, that the
East-India Company would hesitate to allow those privileges to their
fellow-subjects which are permitted to foreigners in a trade, that is so
much out of the line of their own commerce, and therefore cannot be
injurious to it.

Many political reasons, which it is not necessary here
to enumerate, must present themselves to the mind of every man
acquainted with the enlarged system and capacities of British commerce
in support of the measure which I have very briefly suggested, as
promising the most important advantages to the trade of the united
kingdoms.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="v2-c12-hr1" href="#v2-c12-hl1">[1]</a> Bitumen is also found on the coast of the Slave Lake, in latitude
60. North, near its discharge by Mackenzie's River; and also near the
forks of the Elk River.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="v2-c12-hr2" href="#v2-c12-hl2">[2]</a> Independent of the prosecution of this great object, I conceive,
that the merchants from Canada are entitled to such an indulgence (even
if they should be considered as not possessing a rightful claim), in
order that they might be enabled to extend their trade beyond their
present limits, and have it in their power to supply the natives with a
larger quantity of useful articles; the enhanced value of which, and the
present difficulty of transporting them, will be fully comprehended,
when I relate, that the tract of transport occupies an extent of from
three to four thousand miles, through upwards of sixty large fresh water
lakes, and numerous rivers; and that the means of transport are slight
bark canoes.  It must also be observed, that those waters are
intercepted by more than two hundred rapids, along which the articles of
merchandise are chiefly carried on men's backs, and over a hundred and
thirty carrying-places, from twenty-five paces to thirteen miles in
length where the canoes and cargoes proceed by the same toilsome and
perilous operations.</p>
